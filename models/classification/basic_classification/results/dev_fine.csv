0,This paper studies the problem of how to design generative networks for auditory signals in order to capture natural signal priors.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1,"Compared to state-of-art methods in images [Lempitsky et al., 2018], this problem is not so easy on audio signals.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
2,Existing work [Michelashvili &Wolf] trains generative networks to model signal-to-noise ratio rather than the signal itself.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
3,This paper proposes a new convolutional operator called Harmonic Convolution to improve these generative networks to model both signals or signal-to-noise ratio.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4,Applications on audio restoration and source separation are given.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
5,The paper starts to show that an existing generative network Wave-U-Net does not capture audio signal priors.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
6,The explanation in Fig 2 on why this is the case seem to me not so clear. Are you trying to show that the Wave-U-Net does not work since there is no 1/f^2 law for clean audio signals?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
7,"The Harmonic Convolution is similar to deformable convolutions, but specifically designed to capture audio harmonics.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
8,It is further combined with the idea of anchors and mixing to capture fractional frequencies.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
9,The explanation of this section is slightly unclear.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
10,"There is a little typo in Formula 1 for the STFT spectrogram, I would use the modulus |.| rather than || . ||.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
11,Is Harmonic Convolution applicable to complex STFT coefficients as well?,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
12,It seems to be yes based on Section 4.2.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
13,If so it would be better to define the operator in a more general notation.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,2,1
14,Numerical experiments show that the Harmonic Convolution improves over existing regular and dilated convolutions in various settings.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
15,Section 4.2 aims to fit the complex STFT coefficients of corrupted signals.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
16,"However, the setting is less clear to me for both the unsupervised speech/music restoration and supervised source separation problems.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
17,"In Section 4.3 and 4.4, is the x_0 (defined in Section 2.1) complex-valued STFT coefficients or something else?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
18,It seems to me x_0 = ratio mask in Section 4.4.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
19,"What is the L1 loss defined in Section 4.4? To obtain the final separated audio waveform, an inverse STFT is applied on what?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
20,These details can be written in supplementary material if more space is needed.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
21,"After all, the numerical results seem to me encouraging.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
22,This paper presents a new approach in network quantization.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
23,"The key insights of this paper is quantizing different layers with different bit-widths, instead of using fixed 32-bit width for all layer weights and activation in previous works.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
24,"At the same time, this paper adopted the idea form both DARTS and ENAS with parameter sharing, and introduces a new differentiable neural architecture search framework.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
25,"As the authors proposed, this DNAS framework is able to search efficiently and effective through a large search space.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
26,"As demonstrated in the Experiment section of the paper, it achieves better validation accuracy than ResNet with much smaller model size and lower computational cost.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
27,1. An improved gradient method in updating the network architecture and parameters,fine,none,9.0,9,9
28,compared to DARTS and ENAS.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
29,It applies the Gumbel softmax to refine the sub-graph structure without training the entire super-net through the whole process.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
30,The work is able to obtain the same level of validation accuracy on Cifar-10 as ResNet while reduce the model parameters by a large margin.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
31,2. The work is in the middle ground of two previous works: ENAS by Pham et al. (2018) and DARTS by Liu et al. (2018).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
32,"However, there is no comparison with ENAS and DARTS in experiments.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
33,ENAS samples child networks from the super net to be trained independently while DARTS trains the entire super net together without decoupling child networks from the super net.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
34,"By using Gumbel Softmax with an annealing temperature, The proposed DNAS pipeline behaves more like DARTS at the beginning of the search and behaves more like ENAS at the end.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
35,Summary: This paper introduces the task of using deep learning for auto-completion in UI design.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
36,"The basic idea is that given a partially completed tree (representing the design state of the UI), the goal is to predict or ""autocomplete"" the final tree.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
37,"The authors propose a transformer-based solution to the task, considering three variants: a vanilla approach where the tree is flattened to a sequence, a pointer-network style approach, and a recursive transformer.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
38,Preliminary experiments indicate that the recursive model performs best and that the task is reasonable difficulty.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
39,"Assessment: Overall, this is a borderline paper, as the task is interesting and novel, but the presentation is lacking in technical detail and there is a lack of novelty on the modeling side.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
40,"In particular, the authors spend a bulk of the paper describing the three different baselines they implement.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
41,"However, despite the fact that most of the paper is dedicated to the explanation of these baselines.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
42,There is not sufficient detail to reproduce the models based on the paper alone.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
43,"Indeed, without referencing the original Pointer Network and (and especially the) Transformer papers, it would not be possible to understand this paper at all.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
44,Further technical background and detail would drastically improve the paper.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
45,"Moreover, it seems strange that significant space was used to give equations describing simple embedding lookups (i.e., matrix multiplications with one-hot vectors), but the basic technical foundations of Transformers were not adequately explained.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
46,"In addition, only the transformer baselines were considered, and it would seem natural to consider LSTM-based baselines, or some other related techniques.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
47,"In general, the space that was used to explain the Transformer baselines---which are essentially straightforward ways to adapt transformers to this task---could have been used to give more detail on the dataset.",fine,none,9.0,2,9
48,"For example, one question is how often a single partial tree has multiple possible completions in the data.",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,9,0
49,"A major issue---mainly due to the lack of technical details and the lack of promise to provide code/data (unless I missed this)---is that the paper does not appear to be reproducible. Given the intent to have this be a new benchmark, ensuring reproducibility seems critical.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
50,Reasons to accept:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
51,- Interesting new application of GNNs,fine,none,9.0,9,9
52,Reasons to reject:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
53,- Incremental modeling contribution,fine,none,9.0,9,9
54,- Lack of sufficient technical detail on models and dataset,fine,none,9.0,9,9
55,- Does not appear to be reproducible,fine,none,9.0,9,9
56,The paper proposes a novel method for sampling examples for experience replay.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
57,It addresses the problem of having inbalanced data (in the experience buffer during training).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
58,The authors trained a density model and replay the trajectories that has a low density under the model.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
59,Novelty:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
60,"The approach is related to prioritized experience replay, PER is computational expensive because of the TD error update, in comparison, CDR only updates trajectory density once per trajectory.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
61,Clarity:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
62,The paper seems to lack clarity on certain design/ architecture/ model decisions.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
63,"For example, the authors did not justify why VGMM model was chosen and how does it compare to other density estimators.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
64,"Also, I had to go through a large chunk of the paper before coming across the exact setup.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
65,I think the paper could benefit from having this in the earlier sections.,fine,none,9.0,2,9
66,Other comments about the paper:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
67,-  I do like the idea of the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
68,It also seems that curiosity in this context seems to be very related to surprise? There are neuroscience evidence indicating that humans turns to remember (putting more weights) on events that are more surprising.,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,9,0
69,"- The entire trajectory needs to be stored, so the memory wold grow with episode length.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
70,I could see this being an issue when episode length is too long.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
71,The paper proposes an approach to provide contrastive visual explanations for deep neural networks -- why the network assigned more confidence to some class A as opposed to some other class B. As opposed to the applicability of previous approaches to this problem -- the approach is designed to directly answer the contrastive explanations question rather adapting other visual saliency techniques for the same.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
72,"Overall, while I find the proposed approach simple -- the paper needs to address some issues regarding the claims made and should provide more quantitative experimental results justifying the same.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,1,1
73,"- Apart from some flaws in the claims made in the paper, the paper is easy to follow and understand.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
74,"- Assuming the availability of a latent model over the images of the input distribution, the proposed approach is directly applicable and faster.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
75,- The authors clearly highlight the problems associated with existing explanation modalities and approaches; ranging from ones applicable to only specific deep architectures to ones using backpropagation based heuristics.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
76,- The proposed approach to generate contrastive explanations is simple and is structured along the lines of methods utilizing probe images to explain decisions -- except for the added advantage that the provided explanations are instance-agnostic due to the assumption of a latent model over the input distribution.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
77,Comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
78,- One of the problems highlighted in the paper regarding existing explanation modalities is the use of another black-box to explain the decisions of an existing deep network (also somewhat of a black-box) which the authors claim their model does not suffer from.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
79,The proposed approach provides explanations by operating in the latent space of a learned generative model of the input distribution.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
80,The learned generator in itself is somewhat of a black-box itself -- there has been prior work indicating how much of the input distribution,fine,none,9.0,9,9
81,are GANs able to capture.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
82,"As such, conditioning on a generative model to propose such contrastive explanations is to some extent using another black-box (generator) to explain the decisions of an existing one.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
83,"Thus, the above claim made in the paper does not seem well-founded.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
84,"Furthermore, in experiments, the paper does not provide any quantitatively convincing results to suggest the generator in use is a good one.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
85,- While the authors suggest that a latent model over the input distribution needs to be trained only once and is applicable off-the-shelf for any further contrastive explanations regarding any network operating on the same dataset -- learning such a model of the input space is an overhead in itself.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
86,"In this light, experiments demonstrating comparisons between GANs and VAEs as the reference generative model for explanations would have made the paper stronger (as the proposed approach relies explicitly on how good the generative model is).",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,2,1
87,"- The paper proposes an interesting experiment to show that the proposed approach is somewhat capable of capturing slightly adversarial biases in the input domain (adding square to the top-left of images of class ‘8’). While I like this experiment, I feel this has not been explored to completion in the sense of experimenting with robustness with respect to structured as well as unstructured perturbations.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
88,- Typographical Errors: Section 3.1 repeats the use of D for a discriminator as well as the input distribution.,fine,arg-request_typo,5.0,9,5
89,Procedure 1 and Procedure 2 share the same titles -- which is slightly misleading.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
90,"In addition, Procedure 1 is not referenced in the text which makes is hard to understand the utility of the same.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
91,In Section 4.1,fine,none,9.0,9,9
92,", the use of Gradcam and Lime to generate counterfactual explanations is not very clear and makes it slightly hard to follow.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
93,"Citations used for Gradcam are wrong -- Sundarajan et al., 2016 should be changed to Selvaraju et al., 2017.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
94,Experimental Issues:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
95,- Experimental results are provided only on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
96,Since the paper focuses explicitly on providing contrastive explanations for choosing a class A over another class B -- experiments on datasets which do not have real-images seem insufficient.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
97,Additional experiments on at least ImageNet would have made the paper stronger.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
98,"Regarding contrastive explanations, experiments on datasets where distractor classes (y_probe) are present in addition to the class interest (y_true) seem important -- PASCAL VOC, COCO, etc.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
99,"Specifically, since the explanations provided are visual saliency maps the paper would have been stronger if there were experiments suggesting -- what needs to change in a region of an image classified as a ‘cat’ to be classified as a ‘dog’ while there is an instance of the class - ‘dog’ present in the image itself.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
100,"Also, section 7 in Gradcam (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391.pdf) provides a procedure to generate counter-factual explanations using Gradcam.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
101,Is there a particular reason the authors did not choose to adopt the above technique as a baseline?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
102,"- Experimental results provided in the paper are only qualitative -- as such, I do not find the comparisons (and improvements) over the existing approaches convincing enough.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
103,"Since, there is no clear metric to evaluate contrastive explanations -- human studies to judge the class-discriminativeness (or trust) of the proposed approach would have made the paper stronger.",fine,arg-request_typo,5.0,9,5
104,The authors adressed the issues raised/comments made in the review. In light of my comments below to the author responses -- I am not inclined towards increasing my rating and will stick to my original rating for the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
105,Summary:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
106,The paper proposes the use of a hierarchical model for a generative modeling task.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

111,The paper proposes the use of a hierarchical model for a generative modeling task by introducing an intermediate latent variable to enforce the independence of the control and noise variable.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
112,The paper report extensive experimental results to validate the proposed hierarchical model.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
113,This type of framework of crude to fine hierarchical generative model has already been successfully introduced by StackGAN and it's recent variants.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
114,"On the unsupervised disentangled feature learning, the framework provides incremental advancement by using beta-VAE in conjunction with GAN to use the best of both the worlds.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
115,"Even though the proposed approach is similar to StackGAN, the experiments and the results mentioned in the paper are noteworthy.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
116,Questions to Authors:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
117,There are 2 main claims of novelty made in the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
118,1. Architectural Biases:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
119,How is the approach different in comparison to the StackGAN and it's variable which also use multiple levels of crude to fine image generation?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
120,2. Unsupervised control variable discovery:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
121,This part is just the use of existing disentanglement VAEs to extract the control variables.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
122,So how does the paper try to make contributions to improve the disentangled features with the proposed method?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
123,"Apart from combining these to existing ideas, what can be considered as an added novelty to improve the quality of the disentangled features?",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
124,"In summary, I find there is no novelty involved apart from combining the already existing SOTA model in disentangled feature learning (beta-VAE) and image generation (StackGAN).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
125,"This paper addresses the important / open problem of graph generation, and specifically in a conditional/transductive setting.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
126,"Graph generations is a new topic, it is difficult, and has many important applications, for instance generating new molecules for drug development.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
127,"As stated by the authors, this is a relatively open field: there are not many papers in this area, with most approaches today resorting to domain specific encodinings, or ""flattening"" of graphs into sequences to then allow for the use recurrence (like in MT); this which per se is an rather coarse approximation to graph topology representations, thus fully motivating the need for new solutions that take graph-structure into account.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
128,"The setting / application of this method to graph synthesis of suspicious behaviours of network users, to detect intrusion, effectively a Zero-shot problem, is super interesting.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
129,"The main architectural contribution of this paper are graph-deconvolutions, practically a graph-equivalent of CNN's depth-to-space - achieved by means of transposed structural matrix multiplication of the hidden GNN (graph-NN) activation - simple, reasonable and effective.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
130,"While better than most of the baseline methods, the N^2 memory/computational complexity is not bad, but still too high to scale to very large graphs.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
131,"Results are provided on relatively new tasks so it's hard to compare fully to previous methods, but the authors do make an attempt to provide comparisons on synthetic graphs and intrusion detection data.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
132,The authors do published their code on GitHub with a link to the datasets as well.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
133,"As previously mentioned in public comments on this forum, some points in the paper are not very clear; specifically regarding the loss function, the definition of ""edge-to-edge"" convolutions and generally the architectural choice related to the conditional GAN discriminator.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
134,"Clarifications of these points, and more in general the philosophy behind the architectural choices made, would make this paper a much clearer accept.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
135,Thank you!,fine,none,9.0,9,9
136,"ps // next my previous public comments, in detail, repeated ...",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6

138,"- the general architecture, and specifically the logic behind the edge-to-edge convolution, and generally the different blocks in fig.1 ""graph translator"".",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
139,"- how exactly do you do a L1 loss on graphs? I'd have to assume the topology of the graph is unchanged between Gy and T(Gx) ~ and then maybe take L1 of weight matrix? But then is this general enough ~ given your stated goal of modeling different topologies? Either ways, more explanation / and perhaps equations to clarify this loss would be very helpful.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
140,"- why do you need a conditional GAN discriminator, if you already model similarity by L1?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
141,"Typically one would use a GAN-D() to model ""proximity"" to the source-distribution, and then a similarity loss (L1 in your case) to model ""proximity"" to the actual input sample, in the case of trasductional domains.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
142,"Instead here you seem to suggest to use L1 and GAN to do basically the same thing, or with significant overlap anyways.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
143,This is confusing to me.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
144,Please explain the logic for this architectural choice.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
145,"-  could you please explain the setting for the “gold standard” experiment. I'd have to assume, for instance, you train a GNN in a supervised way by using both source (non-suspicious) and target (suspicious) behaviour, and label accordingly?

146,This paper proposes the Cramer-Wold autoencoder.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
147,The first contribution of the paper is to propose the Cramer-Wold distance between two distributions based on the Cramer-Wold Theorem.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
148,"More specifically, in order to compute the Cramer-Wold distance, we first find the one dimensional projections of the distributions over random slices, and then compute the average L2 distances of the kernel density estimates of these projections over random slices.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
149,The second contribution of the paper is to develop a generative autoencoder which uses the Cramer-Wold distance to match the latent distribution of the data to the prior distribution.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
150,"While I found the derivation of the Cramer-Wold distance interesting, the final form of this distance (Eq. 2), to me, looks very similar to the MMD with a particular kernel.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
151,My main question is that: what is the main advantage of the Cramer-Wold distance to an MMD with a proper kernel?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
152,"The paper points out that the main theoretical contribution is that in the case of the Gaussian distribution, the Cramer-Wold distance has a closed form.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
153,"However, I believe this is also the case in the MMD, since if one of the distributions is Gaussian or analytically known, then E[k(x,x')] in the MMD can be analytically computed.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
154,The paper further uses this closed form property of the Cramer-Wold distance to propose the Cramer-Wold autoencoder with Gaussian priors.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
155,"My question here is that how is this method better than the standard VAE, where we also have an analytic form for the ELBO when the prior is Gaussian, an no sampling is required.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
156,"Indeed, in VAEs, the prior does not have to be Gaussian, and as long as the density of the prior can be evaluated, we can efficiently optimize the ELBO without sampling the prior; which I don't think is the case for the Cramer-Wold autoencoder.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
157,I believe the main advantages of methods such as WAE is that they can impose priors that do not have exact analytic forms.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

159,"This paper introduces a new text generation scoring approach using BERT, called BERTScore.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
160,"Using BERT embeddings and optionally idf scores, a greedy matching is performed between all reference and candidate words, with cosine similarity between vector representations as the scoring.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

162,"This notably outperforms BLEU, as well as other metrics, most but not all of the time.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
163,The paper offers a broad range of comparisons and analysis.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
164,Decision,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
165,I'm leaning towards accepting the paper on the basis of the following.,fine,none,9.0,6,9
166,Strong points taken in consideration:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
167,"- Simple, well-motivated metric that uses powerful BERT-style models, without being slow to compute either.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
168,- Good performance empirically on WMT. I'm less convinced on COCO since using the image is fair game there.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
169,"- Code is provided, and it is simple and adaptable for future work.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
170,- Experimentation is detailed and reproducible.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
171,Weaker points taken in consideration:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
172,- Work conducted in parallel matches or exceeds the performance of BERTScore.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
173,"This shouldn't necessarily be a reason to choose not to publish this work in my opinion, but it should be taken into consideration.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
174,I like that the authors were open and clear regarding this in their discussion.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
175,- The authors haven't come up with a recommendation for a single configuration of their approach.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
176,"In one place they recommend F-BERT without idf, in another they argue for picking and choosing based on context, with little help about how to choose.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
177,"I think practitioners are only going to be willing to switch away from BLEU, for example, if a single one-size-fits-all metric is proposed instead.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
178,I identify this ambiguity between BERTScore versions as an important weakness of the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
179,- It's unclear throughout whether words or wordpieces are the main token being considered.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
180,"Most discussion and definitions use ""words"", but in section 3, subsection Token Representation, it appears to be clearly stated that BERTScore uses a BERT model based on word pieces.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
181,I recommend adjust the language to be more consistent throughout.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

190,The paper introduces a novel regularized auto-encoder architecture called the Cramer-Wold AutoEncoders (CWAE).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
191,"It's objective (Eq. 7) consists of two terms: (i) a standard reconstruction term making sure the the encoder-decoder pair aligns nicely to accurately reconstruct all the training images and (ii) the regularizer, which roughly speaking requires the encoded training distribution to look similar to the standard normal (which is a prior used in the generative model being trained).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

196,Detailed comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
197,"(1) My main problem with this paper is that the novel objective proposed by the authors in Eq. 7 is equivalent to the objective of WAEs appearing in Eq. 4 of [1] (up to a heuristic of applying logarithm to the divergence measure, which is not justified but meant to ""improve the balance between two terms"", see footnote 2), where the authors use the newly introduced Cramer-Wold divergence as a choice of the penalty term in Eq. 4 of [1].",fine,none,9.0,9,9
198,"(2) When viewed in this way, CW-distance introduced in Eq (2) closely resembles the unbiased U-statistic estimate of the MMD used in WAE-MMD [1, Algorithm 2].",fine,none,9.0,9,9
199,In other words: it may be the case that there is a choice of a reproducing kernel k such that Eq. 2 of this paper is an estimate of MMD_k between two distributions based on the i.i.d. samples X and Y.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
200,"Note that if it is indeed the case, this corresponds to the V-statistic and thus biased: in U-statistic the diagonal terms (that is i = i' and j = j' in forst two terms of eq 2) would be omitted.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
201,"If this all is indeed the case, it is not surprising that the numbers the authors get in the experiments are so similar to WAE-MMD, because CWAE would be exactly WAE-MMD with a specific choice of the kernel.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
202,(3) The authors make a big deal out of their proposed divergence measure not requiring samples from the prior as opposed to WAE-MMD.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
203,"However, WAE-MMD does not necessarily need to sample from the prior when used with Gaussian prior and Gaussian RBF kernel, because in this case the prior-related parts of the MMD can be computed analytically.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
204,"In other words, if the computational advantage of CWAE compared to WAE-MMD comes from CWAE not sampling Pz, the computational overhead of WAE-MMD can be eliminated at least in the above-mentioned setting.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

231,Summary:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
232,This paper proposes a functional form to model the dependence of generalization error on a held-out test set on model and dataset size.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
233,"The functional form is derived based on empirical observations of the generalizing error for various model and dataset sizes (sections O1, O2, and O3) and on certain necessary criteria (C1, C4 and C5).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
234,The parameters of the function are then fit using linear regression on observed data.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
235,"The authors show that the regressed function \(\epsilon(m,n)\) is able to predict the generalization error for various \(m\) and \(n\) reasonably accurately.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
236,Major Points:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
237,"- While the current experiments are a good start, I do not think they are extensive enough to count as strong evidence for the  power-law form of \(\epsilon(m,n)\).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
238,"I would ideally like to see results on more optimizers, at the very least for Adam, even if for fixed hyper-parameters.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
239,"As far as I understand, this involves only minor changes in the code since reasonable hyperparameters required for the convergence of Adam have been extensively studied.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
240,If the form still holds true then the results from this work can be more reliably used for small-scale network development and in making trade-off choices (as discussed in section 8).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
241,"- Given the current form of the paper, the abstract and introduction should be modified to reflect the fact that only limited architectures and optimizers were experimented with, and the claims of the paper are not experimentally validated in general.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,1,1

245,- It would greatly benefit the reader if eq. 5 were expanded.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,1,3
246,"Overall, I think this is a well written paper and provides good insight into the behaviour of the error landscape as a function of model and dataset size.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
247,The paper’s primary drawback is the restrictive setting under which the experiments are performed.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
248,"Therefore, I am not convinced that the power-law form of the generalization error would hold when the experimental settings are marginally different (like when using the Adam optimizer or a VGG-like architecture).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
249,I think this work would have much greater impact if the authors can show that the power-law form holds for a larger variety of architectures and optimizers thus allowing researchers to more confidently incorporate the results of this work into the design and training deep neural networks.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2

255,"It looks at binary codes for quantization instead of the usual lookup tables because quantization approaches that rely on lookup tables have the drawback that during inference, the network has to fetch the weights from the lookup table and work with the full precision values, which means that the computation cost is remains the same as the non-quantized network.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
256,"The paper presents FleXOR gates, a fast and efficient logic gate for mapping bit sequences to binary weights.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

898,"Second, the authors mention that to avoid storing previous data, they adopt generative replay and continuously enlarge the generator to tackle the significant domain shift between tasks.",fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
899,"However, in this way, when more and more tasks come, the generator will become larger and larger.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
900,The storing problem still exists.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
901,Generative replay also brings the time complexity problem since it is time consuming to generate previous data.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

913,The proposed method is also heuristic and lacks promising guarantee.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
914,The paper has two distinct parts.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
915,"In the first part (section 2) it studies the volume of preimage of a ReLU network’s activation at a certain layer as being singular, finite, or infinite.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
916,This part is an extension of the work in the study of (Carlsson et al. 2017).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
917,The second part (section 3) builds on the piecewise linearity of a ReLU network’s forward function.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
918,"As a result, each point in the input space is in a polytope where the model acts linearly.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
919,"In that respect, it studies the stability of the linearized model at a point in the input space.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
920,The study involves looking at the singular values of the linear mapping.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
921,"The findings of the paper are non-trivial and the implications potentially interesting. However, I have some concerns about the study.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
922,There is a key concern about the feasibility of the numerical analysis for the first part.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
923,"That is, a layer-by-layer study can have a computational problem where the preimage is finite at each layer but can become infinite by the mapping of the preceding layers.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
924,"In that regard, I would like the authors to comment on the worst-case computational complexity of the numerical analysis for determining the volume of a preimage through multiple layers.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
925,"As for the second part, the authors mention the increase in the dimensionality of the latent space in the current deep networks.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
926,"However, this observation views convolutional networks as MLPs.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
927,"However, there is more structure in a convolutional layer’s mapping function.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
928,The structure is obtained by the shared and sparse rows of matrix A. I would like the authors to comment on how the studies will be affected by this property of the common networks.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
929,"All in all, while there are some concerns and the contributions are not entirely novel, the reviewer believes the findings of the paper is generally non-trivial and shed more light on the inner workings of the ReLU networks and is thus a valuable contribution to the field.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

932,I have the following questions/concerns.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
933,"1. The authors insist that their fous is on transfer and not competing on credit assignment. If accurate credit assignment leads to better transfer, shouldn't achieving the best credit assignment model (thus competing in credit assignment) lead to better transfer results?",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
934,2. What effect does the window size for transforming states to observations have on the performance of SECRET?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
935,"3. On a high-level, how does SECRET compare to transfer through relational deep reinforcement learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01830? Relational models use self-attention mechanisms to extract and exploit relations between entities in the scenes for better generalization and transfer.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
936,"Although SECRET intentionally avoids using relations, I think a discussion around relational models for RL is warranted.",fine,none,9.0,2,9
937,I'm curious what happens if SECRET is allowed to exploit relations in the environment.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
938,4. What happens if the reward model uses very few trajectories and is not able to predict good rewards? Does transfer through credit assignment become detrimental?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
939,"In other words, in a real-world scenario, how I do know when to start using SECRET, or when am I better off learning from environment rewards alone? Especially given that SECRET requires 40000 trajectories in the source domain.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
940,5. Are the samples generated in the target domain for collecting attention weights included in the number of episodes when evaluating SECRET?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
941,"For example, in Figure 4. I believe the number of episodes required to collect those target samples should be added to the number of episodes when using SECRET since the agent must interact with the environment in the target domain.",fine,none,9.0,1,9

That's a luxurious way of making coffee :) In the developing world, we still need to boil water, pour coffee powder in it, etc., all without a coffee-brewing machine.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
943,The authors study properties of the learning behavior of non-linear (ReLu) neural networks.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
944,"In particular, their main focus is on binary classification for the linear-separable case, when optimization is done using gradient descent minimizing either binary entropy or hinge loss.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
945,There are 3 main results in the paper:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
946,"1) During learning, each neuron only activates on data points of one class: hence (due to ReLu), each neuron only updates its weights when seeing data points from that class.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
947,"The authors refer to this property as ""Independent modes of learning"", suggesting that the learning of parameters of the network is decoupled between the two classes.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
948,"2) The classification error, with respect to the number of iterations of gradient descent, exhibits a sigmoidal shape: slow improvement at the beginning, followed by a period of fast improvement, followed by another plateau.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
949,"3) Most frequent features, if discriminative, can prevent learning of other, less frequent, features.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
950,"Apart from the assumption H1 of linear separability of the data (which I don't mind), the results require very strong assumptions, in particular hypothesis H2 stating ""at the beginning of training data points from different classes do not activate the same neurons"".",fine,none,9.0,9,9
951,"Even for a shallow net, the authors are essentially assuming that the first layer of weights W is such that each row w is already a hyperplane separating the two classes after initialization (wx > 0 for all x belonging to one class and wx' < 0 for x' in the other class).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
952,"In other words, at initialization, the first layer is already correctly classifying all data points.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
953,"This is of course an extremely stringent assumption that doesn't hold in practice (eg, the probability of such an initialization shrinks to zero exponentially in the number of dimensions and in the number of neurons).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
954,"Because of this concern, I believe the results in the paper can only really characterize the learning close to convergence, since the network is already able to provide correct classification.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
955,Pros:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
956,"- Authors consider a non-linear (ReLu) neural network, as opposed to the analysis of Save et al which only considers linear nets.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
957,"- The fundamentally different behavior between Hinge and binary entropy loss is interesting, and worth analyzing further.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
958,- Sigmoidal shape of classification error as a function of number of iterations is inline with what is seen in practice.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

965,"- Gradient starvation, Kaggle experiment: I'm not too convinced about the novelty/usefulness of this result. In the end, even a decision tree stump would stop growing after learning the dark/light feature as a discriminator.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
966,"What I'm trying to say is that ""gradient starvation"" is a more general problem that really doesn't have to do with gradient descent.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
967,"Also, the fact that the accuracy on the Kaggle non-doctored test set is low is simply because the test set is not coming from the same distribution of the training set.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
968,"The paper proposes to combine several smaller, pretrained RBMs into a larger model as a way to solve combinatorial optimization problems.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
969,"Results are presented on RBMs trained to implement binary addition, multiplication, and factorization, where the proposed approach is compared with the baseline of training a full model from scratch.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
970,I found the paper confusing at times.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
971,"It is well-written from a syntactical and grammatical point of view, but some key concepts are stated without being explained, which gives the impression that the authors have a clear understanding of the material presented in the paper but communicate only part of the full picture to the reader.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
972,"For instance, there’s a brief exposition of the connection between Boltzmann machines and combinatorial optimization problems: the latter is mapped onto the former by expressing constraints as a fixed set of Boltzmann machine weights and biases, and low-energy states (i.e. more optimal solutions) are found by sampling from the model, which involves no training.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
973,What’s less clear to me is what kinds of combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped onto the RBM *training* problem.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
974,"The paper states that the problem of training ""large modules"" is ""equivalent to solving the optimization problem"", but does not explain how.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
975,"Similarly, the paper mentions that the ""general approach to solving these combinatorial optimization problems is to recognize the atomic unit necessary to solve the problem"", but at that point the reader has no concrete example of what combinatorial optimization problem would be mapped onto training and inference in RBMS.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
976,A concrete example is provided in the Experiments section: the authors propose to implement invertible (reversible?) boolean logic circuits by combining smaller pre-trained RBMs which implement certain logical operations into larger circuits.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
977,"I have two issues with the chosen example: 1) the connection with combinatorial optimization is not clear to me, and 2) it’s not very well explained.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
978,"As far as I understand, these reversible boolean logic operations are expressed as sampling a subset of the RBM’s inputs conditioned on another subset of its inputs.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
979,An example is presented in Figure 3 but is not expanded upon in the main text.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
980,I’d like the authors to validate my understanding:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
981,"An RBM is trained to implement a complete binary adder circuit by having it model the joint distribution of the adder’s inputs and outputs [A, B, Cin, S, Cout] (A is the first input bit, B is the second input bit, Cin is the input carry bit, S is the output sum bit, and Cout is the output carry bit), where (I assume) the distribution over [A, B, Cin] is uniform, and where S and Cout follow deterministically from [A, B, Cin].",fine,none,9.0,8,9
982,"After training, the output of the circuit is computed from [A, B, Cin] by clamping [A, B, Cin] and sampling [S, Cout] given [A, B, Cin] using Gibbs sampling.",fine,none,9.0,8,9

984,"I think the paper has the potential to be a lot more transparent to the reader in explaining these concepts, which would avoid them spending quite a bit of time inferring meaning from figures.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
985,I’m also confused by the presentation of the results.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
986,"For instance, I don’t know what ""log"", ""FA1"", ""FA2"", etc. refer to in Figure 6.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
987,"Also, Figure 6 is referenced in the text in the context of binary multiplication (""[...] is able to outperform a multiplier created just by training, as can be seen in Figure 6""), but presents results for addition and factorization only.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
988,"The way I see it, implementing reversible boolean logic circuits using RBMs is an artificial problem, and the key idea of the paper -- which I find interesting -- is that in some cases it appears to be possible to combine RBMs trained for sub-problems into larger RBMs without needing to fine-tune the model.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
989,"I think there are interesting large-scale applications of this, such as building an autoregressive RBM for image generation by training a smaller RBM on a more restricted inpainting task.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

996,"The image of the one-to-one mapping is homeomorphic to R^n, so that it must be an open topological ball.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
997,"The intersection of this open ball with a linear hyperplane must include the boundary of the ball, thus it extends to infinity in the original input space.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
998,"The critical assumptions here, which guarantees the one-to-one property of the network, are: 1) the network is narrow, and 2) the activation function can be approximated by a one-to-one function.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
999,The authors claim that 2) captures a large family of activation functions.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

1001,"As a concrete example, the simple function f(x1,x2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 has bounded level sets, but it can be represented by a narrow 2-layer neural network with the quadratic activation.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1002,"Overall, I feel that the result is interesting but it depends on a strong assumption and doesn't capture all interesting cases.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

1043,as it is not clear how important the faster convergence and more even,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1044,utilization of neurons is (and how it would compare computationally,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1045,with just having more neurons).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1046,This paper develops a multi-arm bandit-based algorithm to dynamically adapt the exploration policy for reinforcement learning.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1047,"The arms of the bandit are parameters of the policy such as exploration noise, per-action biases etc.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1048,A proxy fitness metric is defined that measures the return of the trajectories upon perturbations of the policy z; the bandit then samples perturbations z that are better than the average fitness of the past few perturbations.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1049,I think this paper is just below the acceptance threshold.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1050,My reservations and comments are as follows.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1051,"1. While I see the value in designing an automatic exploration mechanism, the complexity of the underlying approach makes the contribution of the bandit-based algorithm difficult to discern from the large number of other bells and whistles in the experiments.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1052,"For instance, the authors use Rainbow as  the base algorithm upon which they add on the exploration.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1053,"Rainbow itself is an extremely complicated algorithm, how can one be certain that the improvements in performance are caused by the improved exploration and not a combination of the bandit’s actions with the specifics of Rainbow?",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1054,2. I don’t understand Figure 4.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1055,The score defined in Appendix is the average over games for which seed performs better.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
1056,Why is the random seed being used to compare the performance of different arms? Do you instead mean that s and s’ are two values of the arm in Figure 4?,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
1057,"If not, how should one interpret Figure 4, no fixed arm is always good because the performance varies across the seeds.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1058,The curated bandit does not seem to be doing any better than a fixed arm.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1059,I have a few more questions that I would like the authors to address in their rebuttal or the paper.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
1060,1. The proxy f(z) does not bear any resemblance to LP(z).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1061,Why discuss the LP(z) then.,fine,none,9.0,3,9
1062,"The way f(z) is defined, it is just the value function averaged over perturbations  of the policy.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1063,"If one were to consider z as an additional action space that is available to the agent during exploration, f(z) is the value function itself.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1064,The exploration policy is chosen not to maximize the E_z [f(z)] directly but to maximize the lower bound in Markov’s inequality (P(f(z) >= t) <= E_z [f(z)]/t) in Section 4.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1065,2. Can you elaborate more on the metric for measuring the learning progress LP? Why does the myopic metric make sense in spite of the there being plateaus in the training curves?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1066,3. The key contribution of the paper that the authors could highlight better is that they do not add new hyper-parameters.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1067,"In this aspect, the auto-tuner for exploration is a plug-and-play procedure in other RL algorithms.",fine,none,9.0,8,9

1070,The paper proposes using the nested CRP as a clustering model rather than a topic model.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

1238,"However, if we were to quantize different layers of the same network with distinct integer  ratio of bits per weights (say 1 bit per weight for some particular layers and 2 bits per weight for the other layers), the average ratio would also be fractional (see for instance ""Hardware-aware Automated Quantization with Mixed Precision"", Wang et al., where the authors find the right (integer) number of bits/weights per layer using RL).",fine,none,9.0,9,9

1262,"Briefly, this is done by first defining a super network, which is a DAG where for each pair of nodes, the output node is the linear combination of the outputs of all possible operations (i.e., layers with different precision quantizations).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1263,"Following [1], the weights of the linear combination are regarded as the probabilities of having certain operations (i.e., precision quantization), which allows for learning a probability distribution over the considered operations.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1264,"Differently from [1], however, the authors bridge the soft sampling in [1] (where all operations are considered together but weighted accordingly to the corresponding probabilities) to a hard sampling (where a single operation is considered with the corresponding probability) through an annealing procedure based on the Gumbel Softmax technique.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1265,"Through the proposed NAS algorithm, one can learn a probability distribution on the operations by minimizing a loss that accounts for both accuracy and model size.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1266,"The final output of this search phase is a set of sampled architectures (containing a single operation at each connection between nodes), which are then retrained from scratch.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1267,"In applications to CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, the authors achieve (and sometime surpass) state-of-the-art performance in model compression.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8

1273,The architectures are sampled from the learnt probability distribution every certain number of epochs while training the supernet.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
1274,"Why? If we are learning the distribution, would not it make sense to sample all architectures only after training the supernet at our best?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1275,This reasoning leads me to a second question.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
1276,"In the CIFAR-10 experiments, the authors sample 5 architecture every 10 epochs, which means 45 architectures (90 epochs were considered).",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1277,"This is a lot of architectures, which makes me wonder: how would a “cost-aware” random sampling perform with the same number of sampled architectures?",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
1278,"Also, I have some more questions/minor concerns:",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1279,1)	The authors say that the expectation of the loss function is not directly differentiable with respect to the architecture parameters because of the discrete random variable.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1280,"For this reason, they introduce a Gumbel Softmax technique, which makes the mask soft, and thus the loss becomes differentiable with respect to the architecture parameters.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1281,"However, subsequently in the manuscript, they write that Eq 6 provides an unbiased estimate for the gradients.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1282,Do they here refer to the gradients with respect to the weights ONLY?,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
1283,Could we say that the advantage of the Gumbel Softmax technique is two-fold? i) make the loss differentiable with respect to the arch parameters; ii) reduce the variance of the estimate of the loss gradients with respect to the network weights.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1284,"2)	Can the author discuss why the soft sampling procedure in [1] is not enough? I have an intuitive understanding of this, but I think this should be clearly discussed in the manuscript as this is a central aspect of the paper.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3
1285,3)	The authors use a certain number of warmup steps to train the network weights without updating the architecture parameters to ensure that “the weights are sufficiently trained”. Can the authors discuss the choice on the number of warmup epochs?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3

1444,"This is a very strong initial assumption, I am not sure how likely this assumption would be satisfied.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1445,It sounds to me this assumption implicitly suggests that the algorithm is already ALMOST CONVERGENT.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1446,"If this assumption cannot be weakened, I don't think the paper can be accepted.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1447,The underlying motivation for the paper is really interesting and cuts straight to the heart of Deep Learning and strives to unravel the key understanding that we are still to a large extent missing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1448,"When it comes to clarity and organization I find the paper a bit ""messy"" in that it is a collection of quite a few findings on the very specific topic of binary classification with quite strong assumptions.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1449,Especially given the very specific nature of the topic I miss a strong and clear path through the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1450,Unfortunately the paper leaves me with the distinct feeling that there are still a lot of work needed to be able to tell the story about the problem under study.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1451,Having said that the paper does contain several individual findings.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1452,"Having said that I find the ideas leading up to what the authors refers to as ""gradient starvation"" to be really interesting and that would be a great clear idea to focus on.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1453,A few concrete questions/comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1454,"Can you explain somewhere exactly what you mean when you say ""learning dynamics of deep learning""? Given the specific nature of the results presented in the paper it would be nice to be precise also when it comes to the overall topic under study.",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,2,0
1455,Given the very specific nature of the topic treated in the paper I find the title of the paper largely misleading.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1456,"The title claims way more than what is actually delivered in the paper, despite the fact that the authors have put in an ""On"" in the beginning of the title.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1457,"In Corollary 3.3. you characterize the convergence speed in a nice way, but I am missing the link to the behaviors observed empirically in e.g. Fig. 2. What am I missing?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1458,The final sentence in Section 2 is highly speculative and I find this hard to believe without solid backing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1459,"The sentence reads ""... and helps develop intuitions about behaviors observed in more general settings."" Given the restrictive nature of your set-up I find it very hard to believe that this extends to more general settings.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1460,"Tiny detail: The axes of several of the plots given in the paper mis the lables which makes it hard to read. Straightforward to fix, but worth mentioning nevertheless.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
1461,"The paper proposes learning Restricted Boltzmann Machines for solving small computational tasks (e.g., 1-bit addition) and composing those RBMs to form a more complex computational module (e.g., 16-bit addition).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1462,The claim is that such an approach can be more data efficient than learning a single network to directly learn the more complex module.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1463,Results are shown for addition and factoring tasks.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1464,- The paper is somewhat easy to follow and the figures are helpful. But the overall organization and flow of ideas can be improved significantly.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1465,"- The term ""combinatorial optimization"" is used in a confusing way -- addition would not usually be called a combinatorial optimization problem.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1466,- It would be good to understand what benefit does the stochasticity of RBMs provide.,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,2,0
1467,How do deterministic neural networks perform on the addition and factoring tasks?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1468,"The choice of RBMs is not motivated well and without any comparisons to alternatives, it comes across",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1469,as arbitrary.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1470,- That learning simple functions and composing them to compute more complex functions would be more data efficient than directly learning the complex functions does not seem very surprising.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1471,"After all, the former approach gets a lot more knowledge about the target function built into it.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1472,"It's good that the paper empirically confirms the intuition, but doesn't feel like a significant contribution on its own.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1473,"- The paper would be stronger if it includes more complex tasks, e.g., TSP, and show that the same ideas can be applied to improve the learning a solver for such tasks.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1474,"The current tasks and problem sizes are not very convincing, and the accuracy results are not very compelling.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1475,This work explores the extent to which the natural image manifold is captured by generative adversarial networks (GANs) by performing walks in the latent space of pretrained models.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1476,"To perform these walks, a transformation vector is learned by minimizing the distance between transformed images and the corresponding images generated from transformed latent vectors.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1477,"It is found that when traversing the latent space of the GAN along the direction of the transformation vector, that the corresponding generated images initially exhibit the desired transform (such as zooming or changing X position), but soon reach a limit where further changes in the latent vector do not result in changes to the image.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1478,"It is observed that this behaviour is likely due to bias in the dataset which the GAN is trained on, and that by exploring the limits of the generator, biases which exist in the original dataset can be revealed.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1479,"In order to increase the extents to which images can be transformed, it is shown that GANs can be trained with an augmented dataset and using a loss function that encourages transformations to lie along linear paths.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1480,"Overall, I would tend towards accepting this paper.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1481,"Improving the amount of control that we have over generative models is desirable for image synthesis, and this paper does a great job of demonstrating the extent to which these models can be manipulated in terms of mimicking basic transforms.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1482,"Figures are very clean and informative, and experimental results are extensive.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1483,"I don't have much else to say about this paper, as I did not find anything in it that concerned me, and the paper answered all of my questions.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
