1,We’ve expanded the discussion of the results as much as possible.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2,"For now we would prefer to keep the actual bar plot of individual module performance in the appendix in the interest of space, and keep the dataset description in the main part, as this was appreciated by the other two reviewers.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
3,"As you say, the ability to generalize is very important in mathematics.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
4,"The paper contains an extrapolation test set to do exactly this - these include generalization tests on larger numbers, longer sequences, more function compositions (which is similar to having more variables), etc (see Appendix B for more details).",reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,15,11
5,"We haven’t attempted to be exhaustive in types of generalization, but the extrapolation test set can be extended in the future to allow for this.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
6,"None of the modules currently include “unsolvable” as an answer, but this is something that would definitely fit within the framework.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
7,"(As an aside: there would be no need to have a special character; we could simply select some consistent word like “Unsolvable”; neural models trained so far seem to have no problem outputting “True” or “False”.)

8,We always welcome contributions to the dataset that extend the range of questions in a consistent manner.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
9,"Thank you for your positive review, we address your reasonable concern for the applications of the proposed method in below:",reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
10,Q1:  It would be nice to see a better case made for spherical convolutions within the experimental section.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
11,A1,reb_fine,rebuttal_other,10.0,15,10
12,: We believe the best case is the non-rigid shape classification and retrieval.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
13,Our method achieves a state-of-the-art classification and retrieval performance on Shrec’11.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
14,"The good performance on non-rigid shape is mainly contributed by the use of bijective spherical parameterization method, which obtains the input spherical image without topological information losses.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
15,"When using spherical projection method to represent 3D shape, there will be information loss if the object is non-convex.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
16,The lossy input affect the performance of rigid shape analysis to some extent.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
17,Q2: The experiments on SHREC17 show all three spherical methods under-performing other approaches.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
18,It leaves it unclear to the reader when someone should choose to utilize a spherical method or when the proposed method would then be preferred compared to other spherical methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
19,Is there a task that this representation significantly outperforms other spherical methods and non-spherical method?,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
20,"A2: The experiments on SHREC17 does show all three spherical methods slightly under-perform some other state-of-the art approaches, We believe this is mainly due to the information losses introduced in the spherical projection process which retains only the convex portion geometric information.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
21,"Future improvements can be added by using:  (1) less lossy input in spherical projection methods (e.g. on top of SEF, and EDF, we can also add other statistic information such as the minimum distance of intersection, mean distance of intersections or standard deviation of the intersection and so on to reduce the information losses); (2) extend the spherical parameterization method on to the general 3D shapes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,7,1
22,"Currently, the spherical parameterization method only works for genus-0 closed object.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
23,The 3D models presented on ModelNet and Shrec’17 are of arbitrary genus which prevents us from using spherical parameterization method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
24,Generalization of spherical parameterization methods to objects with arbitrary topology will be one of the future work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,7,1
25,"Compared to non-spherical method, spherical image is one of the most compact representation for 3D shape analysis, the spherical convolution methods rely on no data augmentation (for Type I and Type II) or reduced data augmentation (for Type III, only SO(2) rotation augmentation is required).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
26,"Other non-spherical method (such as volumetric or multi-view based methods)  can only be generalized into unknown orientations using SO(3) rotation augmentations, their representation of 3D shapes are either too sparse (voxel model) or too redundant (multi-view projections).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
27,"Compared to SO(3) spherical convolution method (Cohen et al. 2018), our network is computationally efficient (in terms of network model), but we have to admit that this is at the price of required data augmentation",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
28,.,reb_fine,rebuttal_other,10.0,15,10
29,Another advantage is that our network allows local filters and local-to-global multi-level spherical features extraction.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
30,"The other two spherical convolution methods (Cohen et al 2018 and Esteves et al 2018) use a lat-lon grid and conduct convolution in the Fourier space, which has a common disadvantage: the Fourier transform does not support local spherical filters.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
31,"Another disadvantage is the use of lat-lon grid which introduces unevenness of the perception field (due to the high resolution near the poles, and low resolution at the equator).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
32,"Experimentally, we compared the three spherical convolution methods in Table 3 using Shrec’17 perturbed shape retrieval experiment.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
33,"Cohen et al 2018 and ours obtain similar performances because both of the methods used anisotropic filters, the former achieves rotational invariant using SO(3) rotations for filters, while ours achieves rotational invariant using alt-az rotation of filter and SO(2) rotation augmentation of input shapes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
34,"As expected, anisotropic filter perform  better than the isotropic filter proposed in Esteves et al 2018 which limits the model capacity.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
35,Q3:  Is there a specific useful application where spherical methods in general outperform other approaches?,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
36,"A3: As mentioned in Cohen et al 2018, perhaps the most exciting future application of the Spherical CNN is in omnidirectional vision.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
37,"Although very little omnidirectional image data is currently available in public repositories, the increasing prevalence of omnidirectional sensors in drones, robots, and autonomous cars makes this a very compelling application of our work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
38,Omnidirectional vision is a better application to show the strength of the spherical convolution method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8

40,1.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
41,We agree with the reviewer that sinkhorn iteration is a way to obtain an upper bound on Wasserstein distance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
42,"However, based on the original paper, they solve the Sinkhorn divergen with T iterations, later when they solve the generator based on the estimated distance, the gradient has to backpropagate through those T iterations, which is expensive and infeasible.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
43,"We also note that there is new work, IPOT (Xie et al., 2018), which can get rid of backpropagating through the T iterations as what we adopted (Bertsekas, 1985) in the paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
44,Combining PC-GAN with IPOP or other future works could be an interesting future work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
45,"2.  The variance of the sandwiched estimator can be higher, but we are more concerned about bias in this work, which can be treated as a bias-variance trade-off.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
46,"3. The 20:1 mixture used in practice do not directly correspond to s in theory, because the distances we compute are not scaled.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
47,"For example, if the f_\phi, the discriminator of GAN, is k-Lipschitz, the lower bound estimate should be divided by k.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

73,1.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
74,ARTNet is not very much related to our V4D.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
75,"Basically, ARTNet is an alternative for 3D CNNs by replacing 3D convolution layers with SMART blocks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
76,"The SMART blocks are two branch units, with one branch for learning static appearance features and one branch for learning motion features.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
77,ARTNet is a clip-based method for learning short-term representations while our V4D is a video-level method for learning both short-term and long-term representations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
78,"2.	During training, we uniformly divide the whole video into U sections and randomly select one action unit from each section.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

90,"After communication with the authors of ARTNet, we confirm that there are no results published for ARTNet ResNet50.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
91,So instead we implement ARTNet ResNet50 by ourselves and the top1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 is 74.3%.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
92,This is still lower than our V4D ResNet50 whose top1 on Kinetics-400 is 77.4%.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
93,"Also, ARTNet ResNet18 reports an average metric of 81.4%, which is the average of top1 and top5 accuracy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

We were aware of this but for simplicity and the conciseness of presentation we chose to not give this final derivation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,16,3
126,"Also, this was because $P(D_i,I_i|D_{<i},I_{<i})$ is much easier to compute (and more efficient) than $P(D_i |D_{<i},I_{<i})$, given that the computation of $P(I_i| D_{\leq i},I_{<i})$ is in both case required for sampling ($P(D_i,I_i|D_{<i},I_{<i})$ involves a simple product while $P(D_i|D_{<i},I_{<i})$ involves a sum of products).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

292,The source of this bias term is an irreducible error in the coefficient estimate (formed using the hard-thresholding step).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

334,Main comments:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
335,"1/ The DIP approach critically relies on regularization in order to make the method work (both by adding random noise in each optimization step to the input, as well as early stopping).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
336,"As the first reviewer noted ``In fact, the DIP of Ulyanov et al. can hardly be considered ""a model"" (or a prior, for that matter), and instead should be considered ""an algorithm"", since it relies on the early stopping of a specific optimization algorithm''.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
337,"However we follow the reviewers' suggestion and made clear that the idea to use a deep network without learning as an image model is not new and rewrote the item to ``The network itself acts as a natural data model.  Not only does the network require no training (just as the DIP); it also does not critically rely on regularization, for example by early stopping (in contrast to the DIP).''",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
338,"Before that, in the introduction, in the original and revised version, we have a paragraph devoted to the DIP explaining that Ulyanov et al. introduced the idea of using a deep neural network without learning as an image model.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
339,2/ Regarding the theoretical contribution: We fully agree that a limitation of the theorem is that it pertains to a one layered version of the decoder.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
340,"We are currently extending this to the multilayer case, but still have to address a technical difficulty in counting the number of different sign pattern matrices.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,7,3
341,Regarding the assumptions: The proposition uses the assumption that k^2 log(n_0)  / n <= 1/32.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
342,"Here, the constant 1/32 is not optimal.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
343,"k^2 is essentially the number of parameters of the model, and n is the output dimension.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
344,The proposition is only interesting if k^2 log(n_0)  / n <= 1/20 even without this assumption (due to the right hand side of the lower bound) therefore this assumption is not restrictive.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
345,"The bound is applicable if the number of parameters, k^2 is smaller than a logarithmic term times the number of output parameters, i.e., it allows the number of parameters to scale almost linearly in the output dimension.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
346,This is the regime in which the deep decoder operates throughout the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
347,"We agree that many natural noise patterns have structure, and that those can be better approximated with deep models, and are thus more difficult to remove.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
348,"3/ We have added the sentence ``In the default architectures with $d=6$ and $k=64$ or $k=128$, we have that N = 25,536 (for k=64) and N = 100,224 (k=128)",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
349,"out of an RGB image space of dimensionality 512\times512\times3=786,432 parameters.'' to specify the number of parameters.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,15,5
350,Thanks for the suggestion to try second order method like LBFGS; we have tried LBFGS as a response to the reviewer's comment.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
351,"It converges in significantly fewer iterations, but each iterations is so much more expensive that overall it optimizes slower than ADAM or gradient descent.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
352,Minor comments:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
353,"1/ Figure 4: We have added labels and the sentence ``Early stopping can mildly enhance the performance of DD; to see this note that in panel (a), the minimum is obtained at around 5000 iterations and not at 50,000.'' in the caption to clarify.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
354,"Also, we have added the sentence ``Models are fitted independently for the noisy image, the noiseless image, and the noise.'', and rewrote the paragraph",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
355,Thanks for pointing this out!,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,14,15
356,"We agree that here we present only results for one image, but we did carry out simulations for many images, and those plots are qualitatively the same for all the images considered.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,3,15
357,Thus our conclusions about the model do not only hold for one image.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
358,2/ Normalization is applied channel wise.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
359,Let z{ij} be the j-th column in the i-th layer.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
360,Then z{ij} is normalized independently of any of the other channels.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
361,"3/ We have reworded the corresponding paragraphs to make clear that while we do not use convolutions, and thus this is not strictly speaking a convolutional neural network, it shares many structural similarities with a conventional neural network, as pointed out by the reviewer.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
362,4/ The equation is correct in that the parameter choices in the paper are such that the deep decoder has much fewer model parameters N than its output dimension. Thus N is much less than n.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
363,"5/ We agree that it is not optimal to use unintroduced notation at this point, but we made this compromise so that we can illustrate the performance of the deep decoder without introducing its details, but wanted to give a reader the chance to later see exactly what parameters we used.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
364,"6/ Unfortunately choosing k=6 is too small to have a small representation error, i.e., to represent the image well.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
365,"We have, however not hand-selected the 8 images shown out of the 64, and the other 64-8 images look very similar.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
366,We have all the images in the jupyter notebook that comes with the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
367,"7/ Great question, it is faster to optimize the deep decoder since the adam/SGD steps are cheaper, but it indeed seems to require slightly more iterations for best performance than the DIP.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
368,We thank the reviewer for the comments and suggestions.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
369,"As the reviewer points out, the community currently lacks a strong theoretical understanding of minmax optimization, and we believe our work helps to fill this gap.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
370,We comment on the practical implications of our work below:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
371,"1) While the exact form of the sufficiently bilinear condition may be somewhat unwieldy, the result gives concrete evidence that having higher bilinearity can aid convergence for certain algorithms, even for settings that are not purely bilinear.",reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,1,4
372,This indicates that one should pay attention to the magnitude and condition number of the off-diagonal of the Jacobian when constructing a min-max problem and choosing an algorithm to solve the problem.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
373,"2) In non-convex-concave settings, HGD will converge to all types of stationary points, as the reviewer points out.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
374,"We propose some modifications to HGD to allow it to work in non-convex settings in Appendix A, which essentially amount to explicitly determining the local curvature of the problem and running a modified algorithm, such as Hamiltonian Gradient Ascent, near undesirable critical points.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
375,This would allow us to show similar local convergence guarantees to those proven by other works in the area (see Appendix A).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
376,"However, as the reviewer points out as well, the HGD analysis is also useful because it implies similar convergence results for CO, which is a practical algorithm.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
377,"3) Our result for CO shows that as long as $\gamma \ge 4L_g/\alpha$, then CO will converge in sufficiently bilinear settings (currently it’s written as $\gamma = 4L_g/\alpha$ but we will change this in the final version).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
378,"This indicates that increasing $\gamma$ may speed up convergence when we are in a sufficiently bilinear region (and in particular, the algorithm may not converge if $\gamma$ is too small and the region has a very large bilinear term).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
379,"If $\gamma$ is too large, CO will converge to stationary points that are not local min-maxes, so these two phenomena must be traded off.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
380,One could potentially detect which regime one is in by computing a few eigenvalues of the Jacobian (using a logarithmic number of Hessian-vector products) during or after training.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

388,We thank the reviewer for their helpful comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
389,Please could the reviewer clarify why they felt our work muddies the debate regarding large-batch training?,reb_fine,rebuttal_followup,6.0,14,6
390,We demonstrate that one can initially increase the batch size with no loss in test accuracy by simultaneously increasing the learning rate.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
391,However for very large batch sizes the test accuracy degrades under both constant epoch and constant step budgets.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
392,We agree that some of our observations under constant epoch budgets in sections 2 and 3 have been made in previous work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
393,However there are also several important differences:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
394,1.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
395,Our paper is the first to relate the two regimes of SGD to the popular analogy between SGD and stochastic differential equations (SDEs).,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
396,"As we show in sections 4 and 5, this perspective is crucial to understanding the influence of batch size and learning rate on test accuracy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
397,A common criticism of this analogy is that SGD noise is not Gaussian when the batch size is small.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
398,"To our knowledge, we are the first to show that the analogy between SGD and SDEs holds for non-Gaussian short-tailed noise (appendix B).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
399,2. Zhang et al. argued that Momentum only helps in the large batch limit.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
400,"However, their analysis is based on the noisy quadratic model, which cannot explain the results we observed on the test set in sections 4 and 5.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
401,"These experiments clearly demonstrate that, unlike the SDE perspective, the noisy quadratic model is not an appropriate model for predicting test set performance in deep learning.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
402,Their work also does not clarify the assumptions under which linear scaling of the learning rate should arise.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
403,"3. Our empirical results in section 3 are similar to Shallue et al., however their work argues that there is no reliable relationship between learning rate and batch size.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
404,"We draw a very different conclusion: the learning rate usually obeys linear scaling, but linear scaling only holds theoretically when the assumptions we specify are satisfied.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
405,"Linear scaling may not hold in cases where these assumptions break down (e.g., language modelling).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
406,"4. The observation that the test accuracy is independent of batch size in the noise dominated regime is a natural consequence of the SDE analogy, since any two training runs which integrate the same SDE should sample final parameters from the same probability distribution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
407,We will clarify this in the updated text.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
408,Two reviewers complained that it was difficult to tell from the text which contributions are novel and which also appear in previous works.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
409,We apologise for this.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
410,It was not our intention and we will edit sections 1 and 2 to ensure that this is resolved and that the above points are reflected in the text.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
411,Turning to our generalization experiments in sections 4 and 5.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,5,15
412,It is true that a number of papers in recent years have claimed that SGD noise enhances generalization.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,3,8
413,However Shallue et al. recently argued no previous work had provided convincing empirical evidence for this claim.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
414,"Indeed in their abstract, they state ‘We find no evidence that larger batch sizes degrade out-of-sample performance’.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
415,"In another recent paper, Zhang et al. argued that optimization in deep learning is well described by a noisy quadratic model which predicts that increasing the batch size should always enhance performance under constant step budgets.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
416,"Crucially, to establish that SGD noise enhances generalization, one must show that small batch sizes generalize better than large batch sizes under constant step budgets, with realistic learning rate decay schedules, and one must independently tune the learning rate at each batch size.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
417,"In section 4, we are the first authors to perform this experiment and confirm that the final test accuracy of SGD does degrade for very large batch sizes under both constant epoch and constant step budgets, contradicting the claims of both Shallue et al and Zhang et al.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
418,"Furthermore, we show in section 5 that the optimal SGD temperature which maximizes the test accuracy is almost independent of the epoch budget.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
419,These results provide the first convincing empirical evidence that SGD noise does enhance generalization in well-tuned networks with learning rate decay schedules.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
420,We believe this is an important contribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
421,We thank reviewer 1 for the detailed feedback.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
422,"In this response, we clarify the accuracy-realism trade-off, revise the accuracy metrics, indicate reruns and new experiments, and address the individual questions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
423,"We updated Section 4.4 to indicate that it is to be expected that, although our SAVP model improves on diversity and realism, it also performs worse in accuracy compared to pure VAE models (both our own ablation and SVG).",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
424,"A recent result [1] proves that there is a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and realism, for all problems with inherent ambiguity.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
425,"In fact, a recent challenge held at ECCV 2018 in such a problem [2] evaluates all algorithms on both of these axes, as neither adequately captures performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
426,"Although the SVG generator is simpler than ours, ours is just a simple variation from Ebert et al. (2017).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
427,"Since proposing a strong generator architecture is not the goal of this paper,",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
428,any video generator (including the one from Denton & Fergus (2018)) could be used with our losses.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
429,We added this clarification to Section 3.4.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
430,"Instead, we provide a systematic analysis of the effect of the loss function on this task (which could be applied to any generator).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
431,"It's also worth noting that with a simpler feed-forward posterior and a unit Gaussian prior, our VAE ablation and SVG achieve similar performance on various metrics.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
432,We added Section 3.5 to point out the differences between the VAE component of our model and prior work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
433,"We have included a revised plot in Figure 14 (note that this temporary plot will be incorporated into Figure 6), where we use the official implementation of SSIM and replace the VGG metric with the LPIPS metric (Zhang et al., 2018).",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
434,LPIPS linearly calibrates AlexNet feature space to better match human perceptual similarity judgements.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
435,"Aside for the first two predicted frames, our VAE ablation and the SVG model both achieve similar SSIM and LPIPS.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
436,"After examining the KTH results further, we realized that our results are likely weaker than they should have been, because we did not use the same preprocessing as prior work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
437,"The experiments from our original submission cropped the videos into a square before resizing, and thus discarded information from the sides of the video.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
438,We are currently rerunning the KTH experiments and we plan to update the results in the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
439,"We also didn't choose particular hyperparameters to ensure diversity for our models, and we expect some improvement in diversity in the new sets of experiments.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
440,"Although the combination of VAEs and GANs have been explored recently for conditional image generation (Zhang et al. 2018), the video prediction task is substantially different, with unique challenges, due to spatiotemporal relationships and inherent compounding uncertainty of the future.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
441,"Furthermore, while the individual components have indeed been known for video prediction, their combination is novel and not present in prior work, and we demonstrate that this produces state-of-the-art results in terms of diversity and realism.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
442,"In addition, this work provides a detailed comparison of the effect of the losses on the various metrics.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
443,"Furthermore, we are currently running experiments for various weightings of the KL loss and the adversarial loss, and we plan to include additional results that illustrate the trade-offs based on these hyperparameters.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,2,1
444,"Although MoCoGAN performs well for videos with a single frame-centered actor, it struggles with multiple simultaneously moving entities.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
445,The authors of MoCoGAN also mentioned in personal correspondence that the conditional version (i.e. video prediction) was significantly harder to train.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
446,We noticed the same in earlier iterations of our model.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
447,"In our case, we found that the model would degenerate to static videos or videos with a cyclic flickering artifact, which are issues that aren't a problem in conditional image generation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
448,"We added details to Section 3.4 describing the importance of a few components, such as spectral normalization and not conditioning the discriminator in the ground-truth context frames.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
449,The purpose of adding adversarial losses to a pure VAE is to improve on blurry predictions where the latent variables alone cannot capture the uncertainty of the data.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
450,"However, that is typically not the case of synthetic datasets.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

487,"Q: ”Applying the model of Hartford et al. to problems where interacting sets are identical is similar to applying convolution layer to a feature vector that is not equivariant to translation... Do you agree that for this reason, all the experiments on the synthetic dataset is flawed?”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
488,A: Our goal in performing the synthetic experiments was to quantify the expressive power that is  gained by adding our basis elements to [Hartford et al. 18].,reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,1,4
489,"We felt it is an informative experiment since [Hartford et al. 18] also discuss applying their model in the jointly exchangeable setting (page 3, second column, top paragraph).",reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,1,4
490,"Having said that, we agree with the reviewer that [Hartford et al. 18] probably cannot handle such tasks by construction. As we mentioned in our response to Reviewer1 we will change the wording of this section to better reflect that this is *not* a failure of Hartford et al. but merely a setting outside their scope due to a different assumption on the symmetry group of the data.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,2,3

501,Our method can also be combined with DIAYN to learn the skill-conditioned policy as mentioned in the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
502,- We added both a theoretical connection and new experimental results to compare MISC and the empowerment method in the revised version.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
503,"In the navigation tasks, we show that our method outperforms the empowerment method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
504,"- An intuition for why I(s_c, s_i) could be superior to I(a, s_i) is that in robotic tasks, the mutual information between the robotic sates, s_c, and the object states, s_i, could be easier to be estimated than the mutual information between the action, a, and the object states, s_i, as shown in Figure 4 in the paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
505,"Therefore, the agent receives a higher MI reward more easily and learns to control s_i more efficiently.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
506,"The context states can be seen as the summary information of the agent’s action and the transition model of the environment, which could be more relevant in terms of estimating the object states in comparison to the agent’s actions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
507,- VIME and PER are used as described in their original papers.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
508,- We have added an appendix to provide more information about experiment details.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5

520,"Moreover, we show that this yields a scalable algorithm that solves control tasks of higher difficulty than was previously possible using model-based agents.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
521,> I wonder if the authors ever looked at how much the size of the latent vector determines the performance of the system? Is there an optional latent vector size across domains or is that optimal size task dependent?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
522,"For our experiments, we used the same hyper parameters across all tasks, including the state size.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

524,"We find that all sizes equal to or larger than the 200 and 30 used in our main experiments yield very similar performance, while smaller sizes result in suboptimal scores on some of the tasks, hinting at insufficient model capacity.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
525,"> Additionally, how much variance is there in the imagined trajectories from a certain starting state? In other words, are the endpoints of most imagined trajectories similar or very different?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
526,We have not studied this quantitatively.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
527,"Qualitatively, we find more diversity in the stochastic multi-step predictions near states that are more challenging to predict.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

556,“The paper makes use of a result from the David MacKay textbook which defines the capacity of a single layer network to memorize the labelling of $n$ inputs in $d$-dimensional space. [...] It would be great if the paper also made some attempt to consider these connections. Or at least comment on how these factors could be incorporated into a more sophisticated analysis of the capacity of a network.”,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

654,"1- The idea of using concepts to represent a problem is simple, but using it along with neural network based embedding gives us the opportunity to gain concept continuity as discussed on the last paragraph on page 7 and table 2, which is an active field of research in education.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
655,The focus of this work is on problem embedding and its application in a recommendation system that uses problem embedding to project students’ performance for the problems they solved onto the problems that they have not solved yet.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

662,"We are currently running a broader experiment for negative pre-training on other data sets to gain more insight on it, but for the purpose of the task proposed in this work, it outperforms one-shot learning, which cannot be said that is the state-of-the art, but is a common practice. There is no notion of state-of-the-art in training on imbalanced data sets since due to our best knowledge, there is no method that outperforms all the other ones, and the performance of different methods depends more on the nature of the data set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
663,2- The data set being small,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12

670,Hopefully the new results in our response will better aid discussion. Your specific points are addressed below.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,15,14
671,> i) “The proposed architecture is mainly adopted from the graph attention networks (Veličković  et al. 2017) and the relational graph networks (Schlichtkrull et al. 2018).,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
672,Such a simple combination is a good attempt to incorporate both node features and edge features but the novelty is quite limited.”,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
673,We concede that the modifications to the existing models is a minor contribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
674,"We would like to highlight that despite being a simple modification, the implementation of such a model that is trainable in a reasonable time frame is non-trivial.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,15,3
675,We plan to make our implementation public to aid research in the area.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
676,"To generalise the model, following the recommendations in one of the comments, we have investigated applying the Transformer-style dot product attention that was presented in GaAN: Gated Attention Networks for Learning on Large and Spatiotemporal Graphs (Zhang et al. 2018) for non-relational graphs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,5,16
677,"We believe that this additional investigation, accompanied by marginally improved results on Tox21 for dot product attention (Mean test AUCs: WIRGAT 0.838 +/- 0.007, ARGAT 0.837 +/- 0.007) enhance the paper’s contribution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
678,"> ii) “In table 2, I don’t really see any promising results compared to baselines. There are little improvements over the baselines or even significantly worse.”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
679,We agree that the results do not improve on those in Schlichtkrull et al. (2017) or Wu et al. (2017) in a significant way.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
680,This statement especially in light of the more thorough experiments conducted since - we have performed the same level of hyperparameter optimisation to an RGCN model and have found that the there is no gap between RGCN and sum-style attention RGAT.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
681,These results will be included in the new manuscript.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
682,We also feel that some of the results being “significantly worse” is one of the main contributions of our paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
683,"Specifically, the results on MUTAG for RGAT with sum attention are quite a lot lower than its RGCN counterpart.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
684,This was an unexpected result for us as GAT-style attention was anticipated to handle the node-degree imbalances observed to be present in the MUTAG dataset [a statement along these lines was made in Schlichtkrull et al. (2017)].,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
685,The most natural route to tackle this problem turns out to fail - a result which we believe is informative for the community who are trying to solve this problem.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

707,Q:”so,reb_fine,rebuttal_none,9.0,15,9
708,"framing the synthetic experiments as, ""here are some simple functions for which we would need the additional parameters that we define"" makes sense; but arguing that Hartford et al.

716,"A: As discussed in our response to Reviewer 2, We will add a theoretical result that shows that our model is at least as powerful in terms of universality as [Kipf & Welling ICLR 2017].",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
717,Thanks for your comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
718,"We are sorry to say that we miss some previous works, especially the ECCV one. And we will provide more literature review in our updated paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,2,3
719,We admit that the computation process of F-pooling and the ECCV method is the same.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
720,"However, we defend the novelty of our work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
721,The values of our work are not how the output of F-pooling is computed.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
722,"Instead, the values are the strict definition of shift-equivalence and the theoretical properties of F-pooling.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
723,"In previous works, they even don’t give an operable definition shift-equivalence when down sampling involved.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
724,Please refer to our general response for more of F-pooling’s values.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12

728,Thank you for your thoughtful review. We will address your concerns in turn.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
729,Q1: The degradation function F is challenging to obtain in real world scenarios.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
730,"A1: Many state-of-the-art approach, including SRCNN and SRGAN, has their own implicitly defined degradation function.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
731,"They use their function F to generate training samples during their training process, while we use our explicitly defined function F during the inference process.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
732,"If the assumed degradation function F is not exactly the function in real scenarios, both these state-of-the-art approach and our method will suffer.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
733,So it is unfair to criticize our motivation just because we explicitly write out the degradation function F.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
734,"Q2: TV can also be applied for different restoration tasks, and it is easier to be optimized.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
735,A2: We think you underestimate the difficulty of those restoration problems.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
736,Please check the degraded images in Table 3.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
737,These images are damaged so badly that TV cannot recover any meaningful thing.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
738,"As a handcrafted prior, TV performs much worse than our data-driven baseline method in these tasks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
739,Thank you for your insightful comments. We have incorporated your suggestions into the revised version of the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,5,14
740,"Q: Relationship to optimizers with adaptive learning rates, and comparison between Adam and Adam-APO.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
741,"While Adam and Adagrad are often described as having “adaptive learning rates,” they still have a global learning rate that is just as critical to tune as for SGD.",reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11
742,"In our experiments, we consider tuning the learning rate for RMSprop, which also maintains adaptive learning rates for each parameter, and is closely related to Adam/Adagrad.",reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11
743,Adam is essentially RMSprop with momentum; APO can be applied to Adam by applying momentum on top of the updates computed by APO.,reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11
744,"To address your question about Adam, we added experiments for tuning the global learning rate of Adam with APO in appendix Section G, Figure 14, where Adam-APO achieves better performance than Adam with a fixed global learning rate, and achieves comparable performance as Adam with a manual schedule.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
745,Q: Comparison with population-based training (PBT),reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
746,"We have added a comparison between APO and PBT in appendix Section H, Figure 15.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
747,"For population-based training, one must carefully select many hyperparameters, including the size of the population, the perturbation strategy (e.g., randomly perturb the learning rate by multiplying it by 1.2 or 0.8), the exploration interval (e.g., the number of training iterations to run before exploiting other members of the population).",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
748,We used PBT and APO to tune the learning rate of RMSprop while training a ResNet34 model on CIFAR-10.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
749,"For PBT, we used a population of size 4, and chose to exploit/explore after each epoch of training.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
750,"We tried multiple exploration strategies, and found that it was critical to set the probability of resampling a learning rate from an underlying distribution to be 0; otherwise, the learning rates could jump from small to large values, and yield unstable training.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
751,"In contrast, APO only requires a simple grid search over lambda, and all other hyperparameters can be kept at their default settings.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
752,"We found that  APO substantially outperformed PBT, achieving a lower final training loss and equal test accuracy in much less wall-clock time; this shows the advantage of gradient-based methods for tuning learning rates, such as APO, compared to evolutionary methods based on random perturbations such as PBT.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
753,Q: The convergence results appear to rely on strong convexity of the loss.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
754,How is this a reasonable assumption?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
755,"Note that we assume strong convexity of the loss as a function of the output units, not as a function of the weights.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
756,"Hence, our assumption is fairly realistic in the neural net setting.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
757,"The loss function on top of the network output is usually defined as a simple convex function; for instance, in regression, a common choice of loss function is the quadratic loss (i.e, the squared distance between the network output and the true label), which is strongly convex.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
758,"In fact, even without assuming that the loss function is strongly convex and that the output manifold is dense, we are still able to show a fast convergence rate.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
759,"In the updated version of the paper, we show that our algorithm with an oracle converges to stationary point globally with a fast rate, which provides insight into why APO works well.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
760,"Q: In your experiments, you set the learning rate to be really low. What happens if you set it to be arbitrarily high? Can you algorithm recover good learning rates?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
761,"APO is robust to the initial learning rate of the base optimizer, using the default meta learning rate suggested in our updated paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
762,"We have added a section to the appendix in which we include RMSprop-APO experiments on Rosenbrock, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 to show that the training loss, test accuracy, and learning rate trajectories are nearly identical when starting with initial learning rates {1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-7}, spanning 5 orders of magnitude.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
763,Note that 1e-2 is quite a large initial learning rate for RMSprop.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
764,We thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback!,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
765,The suggestion comments were very helpful and led to a clear improvement of our manuscript.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
766,We reply to the answers and comments in the order they were raised:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
767,"(1) While indeed we need more samples of weight matrices than e.g. for applying VI for BNNs for due to the input dependency, we do not believe this makes our method unscalable to real world scenarios.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
768,"Note, that input dependent samples are also needed in the variational training of VAEs (where the number of hidden variables is of course much smaller than the number of weight parameters in our setting).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
769,"While we present the training algorithm naively in an online version for clearness in Algorithm 1, in practice mini-batching can be done efficiently, due to the availability of batched linear algebra operations, at least in the framework we use (PyTorch), e.g. torch.bmm, broadcasting semantics, etc.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
770,"For convolution layers, we can simply use a different type of mixing distribution, e.g. a fully-factorized multivariate normal instead of matrix-variate normal.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
771,(2) Thank you very much for the pointer to VIB!,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,14,3
772,We have added a section in the updated manuscript to compare the objective of CDNs with that used in VIB and VI for Bayesian neural networks (see new Section 4).,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
773,"Furthermore, while we  always used 1 sample during training in the original submission (which indeed makes the CDN an instance of VIB) we now added experiments using 10 samples (see Section 6.4) in an experimental analysis of the different objectives.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
774,The results show that the CDN objective produces superior results compared to VI and VIB.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
775,(3) Of course! We have moved the test accuracy (which previously was only given in the Appendix and thus hard to find) to the legends of the plots to make it more easily accessible.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
776,CDNs give better uncertainty estimates while still having similar predictive power compared to the baselines.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
777,(4) Thank you for the great suggestion.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,14,3
778,"We performed the following 2 experiments for the revised version: First, we picked a weight of a CDN trained on a toy regression experiment (with heteroscedastic  noise) at random and visualized its conditional distributions given different values of x. We found that the means and variances vary for different x.  Furthermore, we picked a weight of a CDN trained on a toy classification dataset (created by sampling x ~ 1/2*N(-3, 1) + 1/2*N(3, 1), and assign y=0 if x comes from the first Gaussian and y=1, otherwise) at random and visualized its marginal distributions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
779,We found that CDNs indeed capable of learning multimodal weight distribution and to learn input specific mixing distributions.. We detail this in Appendix G.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
780,(5) We found that the regularization term has a significant impact on the quality of the prediction and the uncertainty estimate (we found that the uncertainty estimates are worse with small \lambda).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
781,"It makes sure that the variance of \theta is not shrinking too much, i.e. encouraging the mixing distribution to be close to the prior implies it should have similar variance to the prior (which was chosen to be large).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
782,"Naturally, the coefficient \lambda controls this behavior: as \lambda increases the validation accuracy is decreasing while the uncertainty is increasing (and vice versa).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
783,This gives rise to the selection heuristic for \lambda we applied: pick the highest \lambda that still gives high accuracy on the validation set (e.g. > 0.97 in MNIST).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
784,We found that this works very well in the experiments we did (on OOD and adversarial examples).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
785,"Furthermore, indeed CDNs are rather designed to capture the (heteroscedastic) aleatoric uncertainty.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
786,We have revised the toy experiments to better account for that.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
787,"However, curiously, CDNs also work well in tasks that are usually shown as prime examples of epistemic uncertainty, e.g. OOD classification and adversarial attack.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
788,(6) Thank you for this feedback.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,14,3
789,"You are right! We have revised the baseline experiments with Bayesian models so that they either use \lambda = 1 or the settings that the original authors recommended, i.e. we only tune \tau in KFLA and set \tau = 0.01 in noisy-KFAC as these are the settings suggested in their respective publications.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5

891,We perform coreference disambiguation between location nodes of G_t and G_{t-1} via Eq. 1 (call this inter-graph coreference) and between the location nodes in the same graph Gt (call this intra-graph coreference) via Eq. 2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
892,"The inter-graph coreference yields new, intermediate representations for the nodes in G_t.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
893,These are further updated via the intra-graph coreference step.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
894,Inter-graph Co-ref: One way to think about this is that we construct a new graph G_t at every time step.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
895,"Now the graph G_{t-1} might contain some location nodes which are predicted again at time step ‘t’ (e.g., in Figure 2, leaf node already existed in G_{t-1}).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
896,"Instead of replacing an old node with an entirely new node at ‘t’, we take a recurrent approach and do a gated update that preserves some information stored in the node in previous time steps while adding new information unique to time step ‘t’.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
897,Intra-graph Co-ref: Inter-graph co-ref isn’t enough since the MRC module makes its span predictions independently.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
898,"This means that, at time step t, the model could predict the same span/location for multiple entities and add all these duplicates to the graph.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

903,Why does the graph update require coreference pooling again?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
904,"Don't the updates in Eq 1 and 2 take care of this? The ablation does not test this, right?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
905,=====,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
906,We agree that the coreference pooling in the graph update seems repetitive at first glance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
907,We have further clarified the explanation given in the text and included another ablation experiment  (row 4 of Table 5) to confirm its usefulness.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
908,This step does indeed repeat Eq. 2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
909,"In a nutshell, this is necessary because, after the recurrent and residual graph updates (Eqs 3.1 - 3.3) that propagate information across edges, we may end up with different representations for location nodes corresponding to the same location.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
910,We don’t want these representations to diverge from each other because of information propagation.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
911,To give you more detail:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
912,The graph update step ensures information propagation between entities and location representations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
913,"Specifically if the current location of entity “e_t” is predicted as “\lambda_t”, the graph update steps ensures that both the entity and location representation gets the same update (via eq 3.2 and 3.3).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
914,This would have been sufficient if every entity had a unique location.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
915,"But, multiple entities can actually exist in the same location.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

918,CO_2 --> leaf,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
919,"Here both water and CO_2 exist in the same location, leaf.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
920,But let’s say that the MRC model picked the “leaf” span from sentence 1 (of the text in Fig 2) for “Water” and from sentence 4 for CO_2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
921,"In reality, they refer to the same location entity “leaf”.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
922,"Now, due to eq. 3.3, the two embeddings of leaf will get two different residual updates (one would be corresponding to Water and other would be because of CO_2).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
923,"Because of the different updates, the two representations of the same entity might diverge.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
924,"To remedy this, we re-use the coreference matrix “U” we create in eq. (2), which should already have a high attention score corresponding to the two leaf locations.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1058,We introduce our new spectral normalization scheme for convolutional layers because there exist examples where the true spectral norm of a convolution operation can be arbitrarily larger than Miyato et al.’s approximation.,reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,1,4

1199,We want to bring attention to the generic idea of using neural networks as optimization toolboxes to directly solve non-convex optimization objectives instead of merely for learning problems.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1200,"To elaborate, consider optimization problems that arise in unsupervised learning - for instance, ordinal embedding objectives, clustering objectives or dimensionality reduction objectives.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
1201,"These optimization problems are typically not solved directly since there are non-convex, discrete, NP-hard.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

1209,Our experiments demonstrate that we need input representations of size at least Omega (log n) to sufficiently reduce the triplet error.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1218,"We believe that in our case, generalization is realizable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1219,"One possible approach would be to reserve some extra bits in the binary representation of inputs, and then utilize it to represent new items.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1220,The network can be trained with extra batches of triplets which involves the new items.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1225,Though not explained in Section 4.,reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,15,11

1230,"Improvement in 4.3 and 4.4 are basically from the theoretical grounding of NADPEx, which we believe is one of our contributions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1231,"Specifically, improvement in 4.3 is from high level stochasticity's adaptation to the low level; while that in 4.4 could be interpreted with the idea of trust region, that policy should be updated to somewhere near the sampling policy in the policy space, such that collected experience are usable (on-policy).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1232,"In NADPEx, trust region also contains the meaning that dropout policies are close to each other for more efficient exploration.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

1251,=> We chose to focus on dynamics-based approaches in this paper because we found them more straightforward to efficiently parallelize than the published pseudo-count methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1252,This allows us to be able to run more and larger experiments on many environments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1253,"Interestingly, increased parallelization also significantly helped the exploration strategies as shown in Figure 3(a).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1254,"Further, we will add the details of preliminary experiments using pseudo-count in the supplementary.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
1255,"In particular, we were not able to find any official public implementation of the pseudo-count methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1256,"We experimented with a third party implementation trying to see if it could play Breakout without extrinsic rewards, but did not achieve sufficient success and found it to be too slow for scaling it up to a large-scale study.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1272,"We want to emphasis that the accumulator implemented in the newly proposed architectures has an inherently different nature than accumulators used so far: While accumulators such as LSTM cells accumulate knowledge about the state of a sequence, our architectures produce meaningful intermediate results, which can simply summed up to estimate the final set utility.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1273,"Producing such intermediate results, which model the nature of the problem much better than previous approaches, is the key idea presented in this paper and a major benefit of the proposed architectures.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1278,"Hence, the code of the implemented architectures only consists of few lines and can be checked easily.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1279,We think that it is not fair to simply mistrust our results since we made our work fully transparent.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1289,The paper will be updated very soon to include these results.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
1290,Perhaps the reviewer is incredulous regarding this large increase in performance a method as 'simple' as CNE achieves w.r.t. the state-of-the-art.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1

1428,> Table 4 should include the result of training a supervised network on top of random conv1/2 and Scattering network features […] Scattering is a perfectly fine approach for initial features.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1429,Our aim is to investigate the “power” (or lack thereof) of current self-supervision techniques when applied to standard deep network models.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1430,This is of interest because self-supervision is a hot topic of research.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1431,"Finding whether e.g. the Scattering Transform can replace the first few layers of a network is interesting, for example to know if handcrafted features can also do as well as (self) supervision for the first few layers, but not susbtitutive of our core investigation (furthermore, we also look ad deeper layers, where these features are unlikely to be competitive).",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1432,"Still, such an experiment can help put our findings in context.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1433,"This is why we do include them in Table 2 of the paper, where we show that scattering is not quite as good as even single-image self-supervision.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1434,We do think that the suggestion of finetuning/retraining the rest of the model is also interesting after replacing the first few layers is also interesting.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1435,"Still, we think that this can complement but not replace linear probing as the latter is a more direct way of finding what the probed layers can do.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1436,"For instance, it is likely possible to learn a good network even by replacing the first layer with the identity function — it is just a slightly less deep model.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1437,"For these two reasons, we are running the requested experiments and we hope to be able to update Table 4 in the following days.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,7,12
1438,> Can the authors clarify how the neural style transfer experiment is performed?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1439,"Indeed, the method by Gatys et al. uses deeper layers as well, which we also use — straight from the self-supervised method, without fine-tuning or anything else.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
1440,We will update the paper with these details.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2

1442,"Thank you, finding the best single training image, or finding useful synthetic images, are both very interesting ideas. While we are happy to consider doing so as a next step, it is next to impossible to do so in time for the rebuttal (we do not have access to thousands of GPUs).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,14,13
1443,"Nevertheless, we would argue that the paper stands on by making some interesting observation on the ability of self-supervision to extract useful information from more than one (or few) images, and by investigating the role of data augmentation in this process.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1444,We hope that the reviewer will agree that the community will be interested in hearing about these findings.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,14,1

1449,"It is true that we did not quite prove that, so we have reworded the text to tone down this claim.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
1450,"To be a bit more specific, obviously a blank image would not work, and textureless images would probably not work well either.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5

1505,"In the case where we only have both one basis kernel for each of the convolution and the attention, i.e. where B_V and B_v in equation (8) are set to 1, then the difference between RGAT and GAT is only a set of learnable relative scale factors living inside the basis coefficients c_b and c_d.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

1539,The original reason for associating this to the prototypical network was that we employ their zero-shot setup: i.e. we use a VGG network to obtain prototypes on the meta-data and then use these prototypes to define an auxiliary task on the training-data.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1540,4) We do agree that requiring the class hierarchy is a current limitation of the work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3

1542,"One option we are considering is employing an auxiliary regression task, where the generator network would provide vectors and the corresponding loss would be simple regression.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1599,We updated the changes in the latest version accordingly.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
1600,We would like to thank the reviewer for the time and useful feedback.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1601,Our response is given below.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1602,- Interpretation of self-modulation model performs worse in the combination of spectral normalization and the SNDC architecture.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
1603,"Overall, self-modulation appears to yield the most consistent improvement for the deeper ResNet architecture, than the shallower, more poorly performing, SNDC architecture.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1604,"Self-modulation doesn’t help in the SNDC/Spectral Norm setting on the Bedroom data, where the SNDC architecture appears to perform very poorly compared to ResNet.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1605,"For the other three datasets, self-modulation helps in this setting though.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1606,- The ablation study shows that the impact is highest when modulation is applied to the last layer (if only one layer is modulated).,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1607,It seems modulation on layer 4 comes in as a close second.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1608,I am curious about why that might be.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1609,Figure 4 in the Appendix contains the equivalent of Figure 2(c) for all datasets.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1610,Considering all datasets: (1) Adding self-modulation to all layers performs best.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1611,"(2) In terms of median performance, adding it to the layer farthest from the input is the most effective.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1612,We believe that the apparent significance of layer 4 in Figure 2(c) is statistical noise.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1613,- I would like to see some more interpretation on why this method works.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1614,"We consider self-modulation as an architectural change in the line of changes such as residual connections or gating: simple, yet widely applicable and robust.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1615,"As a first step, we provide a careful empirical evaluation of its benefits.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1616,"While we have provided some diagnostics statistics, understanding deeply why this method helps will fuel interesting future research.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
1617,"Similar to residual connections, gating, dropout, and many other recent advances, more fundamental understanding will happen asynchronously and should not gate its adoption and usefulness for the community.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
1618,- Did the authors inspect generated samples of the baseline and the proposed method? Is there a notable qualitative difference?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1619,A 10% change in FID is visually noticeable.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1620,"However, we note that FID rewards both improvements in sample quality (precision) and mode coverage (recall), as discussed in Sec 5 of [1].",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1621,"While we can easily assess the former by visual inspection, the latter is extremely challenging.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1624,"- Overall, the idea is simple, the explanation is clear and experimentation is extensive. I would like to see more commentary on why this method might have long-term impact (or not).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1625,We view this contribution as a simple yet generic architecture modification which leads to performance improvements.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1626,"Similarly to residual connections, we would like to see it used in GAN generator architectures, and more generally in decoder architectures in the long term.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,1,7
1627,We thank the reviewer for their comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1628,"Although our primary contributions are empirical, we also provided a detailed theoretical discussion in section 2, where we give a clear and simple account of why the two regimes arise.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1629,"Although previous authors have also discussed some of these results, there are differences between our conclusions, as we discussed in our responses to the other two reviewers.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1630,We would also like to emphasize that we make a significant contribution to the debate regarding SGD and generalization.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1631,"While many papers have proposed that small batches may generalize better than large minibatches, it was recently pointed out by Shallue et al. that none of these experiments provide convincing evidence for this claim, because no experiment to date has compared small and large batch training under a constant step budget with a realistic learning rate decay schedule while independently tuning the learning rate at each batch size.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1632,We are the first to run this experiment and conclusively establish that SGD noise does enhance generalization in popular models/datasets.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1633,We believe this is an important contribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1634,"We also provide intriguing results as we vary the epoch budget, which demonstrate that the optimal learning rate which maximizes the test accuracy does not decrease as the epoch budget rises.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1635,This supports the notion that SGD has an optimal “temperature” which biases it towards solutions that generalize well.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1636,Additional experiments in the appendix G go further and study how the optimal learning rate schedule changes as we increase the epoch budget.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1637,Thank you very much for the instructive and detailed review!,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1638,"For the first and second comments, we appreciate the detailed example you proposed.",reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1639,"Specifically, we agree with the 1) and 2) of your analysis.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
1640,"For 3), although x^(1)_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}, due to the causal chain and the presence of independent noise in the response function Eq. (1), x^(2)_{t-1} is even more useful for predicting x^(3)_{t}. When Eq. (2) is minimized w.r.t. both f_\theta and all \eta, with appropriate \lambda, it is likely that \eta_1 will go to infinity and \eta_2 will be finite, leading to the correct conclusion that X^(1)_{t-1} does not directly structurally cause x^(3)_t.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1641,"For example, in the new Appendix B.3, we show analytically and numerically that for a linear Gaussian system, the global minimum of the learnable noise risk lies on I(x^(1)_{t-2}; \tilde{x}^(1)_{t-2})=0, i.e. \eta_1->\infty, for a wide range of \lambda.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1642,"To study the general landscape and global minimum of the learnable noise risk, we first carefully inspect Theorem 2, and find that its original statement is not true in general.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1643,We have replaced the original Theorem 2 with a detailed analysis of the loss landscape of the learnable noise risk.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,5,8
1644,"Specifically, there are four properties that the minimum MSE (MMSE, the first term of the learnable noise risk after minimizing w.r.t. f_\theta) must obey, as demonstrated in the new Appendix B. In particular, we prove that the MMSE based only on the uncorrupted variables that directly structurally cause x^(i)_t is the minimum among all MMSE based on any set of uncorrupted variables.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1645,"These properties will likely lead to nonzero mutual information for the variables that directly structurally cause x^(i)_t, at the global minimum of the learnable noise risk, as we ramp down \lambda from infinity.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1646,"In a sense, the learnable noise risk behaves similarly as an L1 regularized risk.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1647,"Whereas L1 encourages sparsity of the parameters of the model, the mutual information term in the learnable noise risk encourages sparsity of the influence of the inputs, where the strength of sparsity inducing depends on \lambda.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1648,"As also pointed out in the “related works” in the revision, the learnable noise risk is invariant to model structure change (keeping the function mapping unchanged) and rescaling of inputs, while L1 or group L1 do not, making learnable noise risk suitable for causal discovery where the scale of data may span orders of magnitude and the model structure may vary.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
1649,"For the third and fourth comment, thanks for pointing out and we have added the constraint-based methods in the related works section, and stressed that we are dealing with “causality in mean” in section 3.1.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
1650,We thank the referee for their review and the summary of our results,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1651,1. We have included some more attacks on the most robust model (a transfer attack and a Gaussian random noise attack).,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
1652,2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_none,9.0,15,9
1653,(a) We have evaluated the adversarial resistance when training a Boltzmann machine with 256 fully connected latent variables directly on the 8x8 patches.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
1654,"The version with only 128 hidden units was not able to reduce the relative entropy to the values of the larger, stacked machine.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1655,We find that the model without stacking is not able to increase the adversarial resistance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1656,It is possible that we are unable to complete the training due to the approximations involved.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1657,"For a small machine (16 units) of full hidden connectivity we can observe the noise rejection behaviour, as shown in appendix D.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1658,(b) We have trained a machine with the same connectivity as the stacked machine directly on the 8x8 patches.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
1659,This training gives similar results to the training in stages.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1660,(c) From the result in (b) we conclude that the particular manner of the pre-training does not matter.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1661,Therefore also the choice of first training set (98% coverage or full coverage) does not influence adversarial resistance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1662,(d) There are a total of 28800 parameters in the Boltzmann machine.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1663,We will gladly provide files with the trained weights and also fully trained neural networks on request.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1664,"3. We currently do not have a full explanation for the large adversarial resistance, but noise resistance must play a part in it.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1665,The very strong rejection of Gaussian noise and the observations in Fig. 4 point in this direction.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1666,"With all our due respect to Reviewer #3’s valuable time and effort in reviewing our manuscript, we must admit that we are a bit upset by this last late review, due to the apparent lack of understanding before placing comments, and several factual errors that make the current comments at least poorly grounded.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
1667,We understand that the idea of “model falsification as model comparison” might not be trivial to understand for people primarily from practical deep learning backgrounds.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1668,The idea is deeply rooted in a successful series of studies from image perceptual assessment research: a basic introduction can be found in (Wang & Simoncelli (2008)).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1669,We notice that Reviewer #2 also kindly points out another interdisciplinary foundation of MAD in software differential testing.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1670,"We hope Reviewer #3 can carefully read the below explanation, and reconsider the rating to a more serious and appropriate one.",reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1671,Q1:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1672,One of the main advantages is that it can select a sample set from an arbitrarily large unlabeled images.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1673,"However, to compare different classifiers, the proposed algorithm still needs humans to annotate the selected dataset, which is very expensive compared with traditional methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1674,Response:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1675,"Our method is very efficient in terms of human annotation budget compared with traditional methods, which is one of the main claims we elaborated in our paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1676,We are disappointed that this major important point was not well understood.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
1677,"In fact, MAD provides the very first and efficient solution (in the context of image classification) to exploit a large-scale image set under the constraint of the very limited budget for human labeling.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1678,We have noticed that the other two reviewers agree with us and appreciate this point.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
1679,"For example, quote Reviewer #2: “Because of the efficacy of such ""worst-case"" comparison, the needed set size is very small and thus minimizes the human annotation workload”.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1680,"To evaluate the relative performance of two ImageNet classifiers, traditional evaluation methods compute accuracy on a fixed test set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1681,"For ImageNet validation set, human annotations for 50,000 images need to be provided.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1682,"This number is large in terms of human labeling effort, but is extremely small compared to the set of all natural images (the natural image manifold).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1683,"As also mentioned by the reviewer, annotation for each image is a 1000-class classification task, which makes the labeling task more difficult compared to a binary classification problem.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1684,"In contrast, rather than comparing fixed test sets which are typically small, the proposed MAD adaptively samples a test set from an arbitrarily large corpus of unlabeled images so as to maximize the discrepancies between the classifiers, measured by the distance over WordNet hierarchy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1685,"Human labeling is only required on the resulting small and model-dependent image sets, which contains only k=30 images (for each pair of classifiers) on the ImageNet experiment as reported in our paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1686,Our experiments show that the MAD ranking stabilizes at around k>15 (see figure 5) and successfully tracks the recent progress in image classification .,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1687,"For comparing 11 classifiers, the total labeled images needed are 1,650 (see page 6): it is obviously smaller than 50,000 and leaves much room to compare more classifiers (before it reaches 50, 000).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1688,"In conclusion, our method is apparently much more efficient in terms of human annotation budget compared with traditional methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1798,(1) We emphasize fundamental differences between Cakewalk and CE.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1799,These go beyond the differences the reviewer mentions.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
1800,"(2) How the sampling distribution should not be considered as a part of Cakewalk, and that it is mostly provided as an example, and a basis for the reported experiments.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
1801,(3) The experiments include results two tasks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
1802,"Nonetheless, it appears the paper doesn’t convey this clearly, and we suggest two possible ways how to update the paper in this regard.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1803,"Next, we try to answer the specific issues the reviewer mentions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1804,"First, we address the suggestion of introducing Cakewalk as a generalization of CE.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1805,While we were writing the paper we in fact considered presenting Cakewalk as the reviewer suggests.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1806,"We eventually decided against this approach as CE is a method for adapting an importance sampler, and its convergence guarantees only apply when it is treated as such.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1807,The convergence guarantees of REINFORCE on the other hand still apply under our surrogate objective framework.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1808,"This property allows us to explore various surrogates, where one such construction allows us to interpret CE as a policy gradient method, and another makes the basis for Cakewalk.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1809,"Second, we address the issue of using a sampling distribution that assumes independence between the different dimensions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1810,"As the author correctly states, such a distribution will not always be useful, and one can design a problem for which this distribution will lead to a poor local optimum.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
1811,Note however that a global maximizer for the objective suggested by the reviewer can be easily found just by random sampling: sampling such a maximizer has the same probably as sampling an odd integer - half.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1812,"Nonetheless, for the clique problem such a distribution can be effective.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1813,"Intuitively, if some node i is part of a large clique, then sampling x_i=1 is likely to result in a good objective as there are many nodes that are connected to i, and the chance of not sampling any of them decreases with the clique size.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1814,"In this way, over time the probability for sampling such nodes becomes higher, and the chance of sampling all of them together increases.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1815,A similar reasoning applies for the k-medoids problem.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1816,We note that these kind of factorized distributions have a long history of being useful in machine learning.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1817,"In a similar context to the one studied in the paper, such distributions have been studied by Rubinstein in his paper which discusses CE as an algorithm for combinatorial optimization, and in the classical bandit papers Exp3 is applied independently to several dimensions to study game theoretic problems.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1818,"In different contexts, such distributions have also been used as naive mean field approximations in variational inference.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1819,"Next, we address the question regarding the gradient update types.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1820,One intuitive explanation for why an algorithm that maintains a ‘memory’ of previous gradient updates like AdaGrad or Adam is required,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
1821,is that they protect against sampling biases.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1822,"Consider for example the case when the execution is at the start, and the sampling distribution still has maximum entropy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1823,"Due to the combinatorial nature of the solution space, the examples that have been sampled thus far create a distorted representation of the solution space.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1824,"In this case we could get that some x_i=j will occur few times, while some other x_k will not receive the value j at all.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1825,Now if we apply vanilla gradient updates this can skew the sampling distribution in random directions.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1826,Gradient updates such as those of AdaGrad and Adam on the other hand will lessen the impact of such deviations as the importance of each case is inversely proportional to the number of previous observations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1827,"As such deviations will inevitably occur whenever we rely on polynomially sized samples to represent a combinatorial solution space, without such corrections a gradient based adaptive sampling algorithm will almost surely fail.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1828,"Indeed, as can be seen in tables 1,2 and 4, SGA almost never leads to a locally optimal solution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1829,"Furthermore, this reasoning explains why AdaGrad is superior to Adam: AdaGrad corrects against sampling biases that entail all the examples that have been encountered, while Adam does this only within some exponentially moving time window.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1830,"Indeed, this phenomenon is studied in detail in the AdaGrad paper (though without assuming a data distribution), and sparse data like ours (one can say our data points are N indicator vectors of length M) is the first motivating example in their paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1994,"Originally, to justify the I^u=1/2 \sum_l log(1+Var(X^(j)_{t-1,l})/ \eta_{j,l}^2) term used in our experiments for estimating mutual information, we used diagonal Gaussian assumption for X_{t-1}^(j) in the experiment.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1995,"In fact, a better way to justify this is to note that I^u provides an upper bound for the mutual information subject to the constraint of known variance of marginal distributions of X^(j)_{t-1}, and the upper bound is reached with the diagonal Gaussian distribution, as is proved in Appendix C in the revision.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

2007,-  Comparison with conventional triplet methods using images and their corresponding RGB images,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2008,We did not consider comparisons with conventional triplet approaches: the message of our paper was not to demonstrate the utility of ordinal embedding approaches over conventional (representation-based) triplet approaches.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2009,"It was rather to show that when input representations are NOT available, we provide a scalable approach to solve the ordinal embedding problem.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2010,"We agree with the reviewer that such a comparison would be possible but the experiments, we believe, would not reflect the message of the paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
2011,-  More synthetic experiments comparing the various ordinal embedding approaches,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2012,"There is a large literature that compares existing ordinal embedding approaches, and in order to not overload the figures, we had decided to just compare against the most popular traditional algorithms. But we can definitely add more comparisons in the revision of the paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
2013,-,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
2014,The “claim that the use of neural networks with discrete inputs can approximately solve NP-hard optimization problems”,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2015,We would like to clarify that our claim was merely that we use neural networks to address ONE instance of an NP-hard optimization problem.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2016,We want to bring attention to the generic idea of using neural networks as optimization toolboxes to directly solve non-convex optimization objectives instead of merely for learning problems.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2017,We thank the reviewer for the evaluation.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2018,Please see our detailed response to several recurring issues at https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkx-ii05FQ&noteId=HygFbNmL6X.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2019,In that response we address the following issues:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2020,(1) We emphasize fundamental differences between Cakewalk and CE.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2021,"(2) How the sampling distribution should not be considered as a part of Cakewalk, and that it is mostly provided as an example, and a basis for the reported experiments.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
2022,(3) The experiments include results two tasks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
2023,"Nonetheless, it appears the paper doesn’t convey this clearly, and we suggest two possible ways how to update the paper in this regard.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2024,"Next, we’ll try to provide some intuition as to why a sampling distribution that assumes independence between the different dimensions can be useful in some cases.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2025,"The simple explanation is that in some problems the conditional expectation of the objective given that some x_i=j is much better than for other values x_i=k. In such cases, for each dimension the algorithm will tend to sample values which are useful to many possible solutions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2026,"In the clique problem for example, if some node i is part of a large clique, then sampling x_i=1 is likely to result in a good objective as there are many nodes that are connected to i, and the chance of not sampling any of them decreases with the clique size.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2027,"In this way, over time the probability for sampling such nodes becomes higher, and the chance of sampling all of them together increases.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2028,"Lastly, we note that these kind of factorized distributions have a long history of being useful  in machine learning.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2029,"In a similar context to the one studied in the paper, such distributions have been studied by Rubinstein in his paper which discusses CE as an algorithm for combinatorial optimization, and in the classical bandit papers Exp3 is applied independently to several dimensions to study game theoretic problems.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2030,"In different contexts, such distributions have also been used as naive mean field approximations in variational inference.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2031,We thank Reviewer 1 (R1) for their review and for asking interesting questions that helped us to understand where our paper may have been unclear.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2032,"In our response below we will try our best to better explain our motivation for building and using SQOOP, as well as address R1’s other questions and concerns.",reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2033,"A key concern that R1 expressed in their review is that we perform our study on the new SQOOP dataset, instead of using an available one (for example CLEVR or Abstract Scenes VQA).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2034,Though we appreciate the concern (it has spurred us to rethink and rephrase how we justify SQOOP) we still believe that the SQOOP dataset is the best choice for precisely testing our ideas.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,3,13
2035,We kindly invite R1 to consider the following arguments in favor of doing so:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2036,The goal of our study was to perform a thorough investigation of systematic generalization of language understanding models.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2037,"To that end, we wanted a setup that is as simple as possible, while still being challenging by testing the ability to extend the relational reasoning learned to unseen combinations of seen words.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2038,"We therefore choose to focus on simplest relational questions of the form XRY, as they also allow us to factor out challenges of discrete optimization in choosing the right module layout (required for Stochastic N2NMN).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2039,"The simplicity is also useful because most models get to 100% accuracy on the training set of SQOOP, which allowed us to put aside any remaining optimization challenges and just focus our study on systematic generalization.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2040,"In contrast, we find that the popular CLEVR dataset does not satisfy our requirements and if we did modify it sufficiently, we believe that it would only differ from SQOOP in the actual rendering and would not affect our conclusions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2041,"Though visually more complex, CLEVR has only 3 object types: cylinder, sphere and cube.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2042,"Therefore, it would only allow for 3x4x3=36 different XRY relational questions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2043,"This is arguably not enough to sufficiently represent real world situations, and would definitely hinder our experiments.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2044,"Specifically, we would not be able to sufficiently vary the difficulty of our generalization challenge when allowing 1,2,4,8 or 18 possible right hand-side objects in the questions (we clarify why splits with lower #rhs/lhs are more difficult than those with higher #rhs/lhs later in this response).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2045,"Hence, we did not find the original CLEVR readily appropriate for our study.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
2046,"We could, in theory, introduce new object types to CLEVR and rerender a new dataset in 3D using Blender (the renderer that was used to create CLEVR) with different lighting conditions and partial occlusions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2047,"Though enticing, we believe that such a 3D version of SQOOP would lead to exactly same conclusions, because the vision required to recognize the objects in the scene would still be rather trivial.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2048,"The Ying and Yang dataset is clearly a valuable resource (and we thank the reviewer for the pointer), but we do not think it is readily suitable for the kind of study that we aim to perform.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
2049,"The dataset, to the best of our understanding, uses crowd-sourced questions (as the questions are taken from Abstract VQA dataset, whose captions were entered by a human, according to the original VQA paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00468v6.pdf).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2050,"Using crowd-sourced questions would not allow us to control our experiments at the level of precision that we wanted to achieve (e.g. we would not know the ground-truth layouts, it would be harder to construct splits of varying difficulty, etc.).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2051,"As well, Abstract VQA contains only 50k scenes, and from our experience with SQOOP we know that this number would be not sufficient to rule out overfitting to training images as a factor.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2052,We thank R1 for their constructive suggestion to consider NMNs that form a DAG.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14

2054,"We hope that these results, combined with further qualitative investigations we are conducting, will answer the legitimate question of R1 as to why Chain-NMN performs so much worse than Tree-NMN.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,14,2
2055,"We acknowledge that the text of the paper can be improved to explain better why splits with lower #rhs/lhs are generally harder than those with higher #rhs/lhs, and we thank R1 for pointing this",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3

2057,.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,15,3
2058,Our reasoning is that lower #rhs/lhs are harder because the training admits more spurious solutions in them.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2059,In such spurious regimes models adapt to the specific lhs-rhs combinations from the training and can not generalize to unseen lhs-rhs combinations (i.e. generalizing from questions about “A” in relation with “B” to “A” in relation to “D” (as in #rhs/lhs=1) is more difficult than generalizing from questions about “A” in relation to “B” and “C” to the same “A” in relation to “D” (as in #rhs/lhs=2).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2060,We will update the paper to be more explicit in explaining these considerations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
2061,"We would like to conclude our response by replying to the higher-level concern of R1 that the findings of our study may not “generalize to other more complex datasets where the network layout NMN might be more complex, the number of modules and type of modules might also be more”.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2062,"While we fully agree that more complex datasets with more complex questions would bring new challenges, these are ones we purposely put aside (such as the general unavailability of ground-truth layouts for vanilla NMN, the need to consider an exponentially large set of possible layouts for Stochastic N2NMN, etc.) We believe that it is highly valuable for the research community to know what happens in the simple ideal case of SQOOP, where we can precisely test our specific generalization criterion.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2063,"This knowledge (e.g. the superiority of trees to chains, the sensitivity of layout induction to initialization, the emergence of spurious parameterization in end-to-end learning), will guide researchers in choosing, designing and troubleshooting their models, as they now know what to expect modulo the optimization challenges that they may face.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2064,"The field of language understanding with deep learning is not easily amenable to mathematical theoretical investigations and, with that in mind, rigorous minimalistic studies like ours are arguably very important.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2065,"To some extent, they play the role of the former: they inform researcher intuition and lay a solid foundation for scientific dialogue.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2066,"We purposely traded breadth for depth in our investigations, and we will go even deeper in the additional experiments that the upcoming revision will contain.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,7,1
2067,We believe that the total of our results makes a complete conference paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2068,"All that said, we would welcome specific suggestions of additional experiments that we could carry out in order to better validate our claims.",reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2069,"We hope that this response has clarified to R1 what our paper was insufficiently clear about. A new revision with additional experiments and fixed typos will soon be uploaded to OpenReview, and we hope that R1 takes this response and the changes that we will make to the paper into account.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2

2074,We stressed this setup in Section 3.2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2154,We thank the reviewer for their helpful comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2155,We agree that our most surprising results are for SGD under constant step budgets or unlimited epoch budgets.,reb_fine,rebuttal_accept-praise,0.0,3,0
2156,"However the behaviour of SGD under constant epoch budgets has generated a lot of debate in the literature in recent years, and we felt it was important to address this simple case first.",reb_fine,rebuttal_accept-praise,0.0,1,0
2157,"We agree that some of the observations in sections 2 and 3 have already been made in previous work, however there are also several important differences:",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2158,"1. Ma, Bassily and Belkin also introduced the notion of two regimes, however their theory holds for convex losses in the interpolating regime.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2159,We will discuss their contribution explicitly in the updated text.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,2,8
2160,Our discussion in section 2 clarifies why the two regimes arise in practical deep learning models for which these conditions may not hold.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2161,2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,15,8
2162,Our paper is the first to relate the two regimes of SGD to the popular analogy between SGD and stochastic differential equations (SDEs).,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2163,"As we show in later sections, this perspective is crucial to understanding the influence of batch size and learning rate on test accuracy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2164,A common criticism of this analogy is that SGD noise is not Gaussian when the batch size is small.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2165,"To our knowledge, we are the first to show that the analogy between SGD and SDEs holds for non-Gaussian short-tailed noise (appendix B).",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2166,3. We clarify the differences to some other recent papers in our reply to reviewer 1.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,5,8
2167,Two reviewers complained that it was difficult to tell from the text which contributions are novel and which also appear in previous works.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,15,3
2168,We apologise for this.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2169,It was not our intention and we will edit sections 1 and 2 to ensure that this is resolved and that the above points are reflected in the text.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,2,5
2170,Turning to our generalization experiments in sections 4 and 5.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2171,We agree that many authors have proposed that SGD noise enhances generalization.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2172,"Most notably, Keskar et al. argued that large minibatches perform worse than small minibatches on the test set, even when both achieve similar performance on the training set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
2173,"However their experiments do not provide convincing evidence for this claim, because they tuned the learning rate with small batches and then used the same learning rate value with large batches.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2174,"A convincing experiment should independently tune the learning rate at all batch sizes under a constant step budget, and it should use a realistic learning rate decay schedule.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2175,"Indeed, Shallue et al. recently argued that no existing paper has provided convincing evidence that small batch sizes generalize better than large batch sizes under constant step budgets, and they state in their abstract ‘We find no evidence that larger batch sizes degrade out-of-sample performance’.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2176,"Meanwhile, Zhang et al. argued that optimization in deep learning is well described by a noisy quadratic model which predicts that increasing the batch size should always enhance performance under constant step budgets.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2177,"To our knowledge, our experimental results in section 4 are the first to provide convincing evidence that very large minibatches do perform worse than small batch sizes on the test set, even under constant step budgets and when the learning rate is independently tuned.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2178,We believe this is an important contribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2179,"Meanwhile, our results in section 5 suggest that SGD has an optimal temperature early in training which promotes generalization and is independent of the epoch budget.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
2180,In response to the reviewer’s specific comments:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2181,"1) Looking at Figure 1c, while the optimal learning rate at 8k with Momentum is 4, the error bars at this batch size range from 4 to 32.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2182,"These error bars can be very large in the curvature regime, precisely because the optimal learning rate is close to instability.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2183,"2) Yes, Momentum will help under constant step budgets if the batch size is large, since it enables us to achieve larger effective learning rates which are beneficial for generalization.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2189,>Discussions sometimes lack depth or are absent.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2190,-We have added an additional section (Appendix G) expanding on our discussion and providing additional insight into the observed instabilities.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2191,">For example, it is unclear to me why some larger models are not amenable to truncation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2192,"Besides visible artifacts, what does it mean? Why does a smoother G reduces those artifacts?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2193,"-Truncation introduces a train-test disparity in G’s inputs--at sampling time, G is given a distribution it has effectively never seen in training.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2194,The observation that imposing orthogonality constraints improves amenability to truncation is empirical.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2195,"Our suspicion is that if G is not encouraged to be “smooth” in some sense, then it is likely that G will only properly generate images given points from the untruncated distribution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2196,"We hypothesize that models which are not amenable end up learning mappings which, when given truncated noise, either attenuate or amplify certain activation pathways, leading to extreme output values (hence the observed saturation artifacts).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2197,"We speculate that encouraging G’s filters to have minimum pairwise cosine similarity means that, when exposed to distribution shift, the network’s features are less correlated and less likely to align and amplify an activation path it would otherwise have learned to scale properly.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2198,>Were samples from those networks better without using truncation? Why would this be?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2199,"-Samples from those networks without truncation do not have measurably different quality, and their training metrics (losses, singular values) show no differences.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2200,"Aside from empirically testing each network individually for amenability to truncation, we found no other way to check for that amenability.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2201,"> Authors report how wider networks perform best, and how deeper networks degrade performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2202,"Again, discussions are lacking, and it doesn’t seem the authors tried to understand why such behaviors were shown.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2203,"Even though this is mostly an empirical investigation, I think some more efforts should be put in understanding and explaining why some of those behaviors are shown, as I think it can bootstrap future work more easily.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,7,8
2204,-We are wary of explanations for which we do not have evidence.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2205,"For each of the modifications introduced in Section 3, we offer a succinct conjecture as to why that change improves performance, but we are not aware of any existing reliable, informative metric which we could employ to understand or trace the source of each observed behavior, particularly with respect to GAN stability or performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2206,"Regarding depth vs width: This paper is empirical, and we only briefly experimented with increasing depth analogously to increasing width.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2207,"While increasing width provided an immediate measurable benefit, increasing depth did not.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2208,We felt that it was better to report the results of this brief investigation than to omit it for a lack of investigatory depth.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2209,"> In Section 3.1 : “Across runs in Table 1, we observe that without Orthogonal Regularization, only 16% of models are amenable to truncation compared to 60% with Orthogonal Regularization.” For me, this is not particularly clear.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2210,Is this something the reader should understand from Table 1?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2211,"-This means that of all the models we trained for the study presented in Table 1 which did not use Orthogonal Regularization, only 16% were amenable to truncation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2212,"Of all the models which we trained for the study presented in Table 2 which did use Orthogonal Regularization, 60% were amenable to truncation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2213,"This is not reflected in Table 1, which is merely a presentation of how the introduced modifications impact performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2214,>I question the choice of sections chosen to be in the main paper/appendices.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2215,I greatly appreciated the negative results reported in the main text as well as in the appendices and this has significant value.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2216,"However, as this is to me mostly a detailed empirical investigation and presentation of high-performance GANs on large scales, I would be likely to share this with colleagues who want to tackle similar problems.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2217,"In this case, if future readers limit themselves to the main text, I think it can have more value to present some content form Appendix B and C than to have more than a full page on stability investigations and attempted tricks that turned out not to be used to reach maximal performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2218,"However I do not want to discourage publishing of negative results, and I definitely wish to see this investigation in the paper, but I merely question the positioning of such information.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2219,"With regard to my first negative point above about the lack of discussions, it seems the analysis of Section 4 is disproportionate compared to other places.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2220,-We appreciate this suggestion.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2221,"While we recognize that this paper generally has a strong focus on implementation details, we felt that this instability was one of the most salient behaviors we observed, and that future work would be best served by presenting our investigations and attempts to understand its source, even if these methods did not improve performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,3,8
2222,"The information in Appendix B and C is intended to be of interest to those who want to reproduce our experiments, so it largely comprises hyperparameters and architectural details that we felt were not necessary to understand the main results of the paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2223,">In Appendix F, Figure 20 d), the title seems wrong. It seems to report sigma^2 values, but the title says “losses”.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2224,"-Thanks! This was indeed an error, which we’ve corrected in the updated draft.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2225,>I would also be curious to see the proposed techniques applied on simpler datasets. Can this be useful for someone having less compute power and working on something similar to CelebA?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2226,-The goal of this work is to explore GANs at large scale; the exploration of small or medium scale models would indeed be interesting for another study.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2227,"Having said that, we do evaluate BigGAN on conditional CIFAR-10 (mentioned briefly in Appendix C.2) and obtain an IS of 9.22 and an FID of 14.73 without truncation, which to our knowledge are better than any published results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2228,Thank you very much for your constructive comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2229,"First, with respect to baselines, we have updated the results tables to include the additional baselines mentioned, as well as runs for VAT(+EntMin) with lower numbers of labels on CIFAR-10.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5

2231,We have also updated the text to tone down the claims.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2232,"In addition, we note that the highest performance in many of the mentioned baselines (and with VAT) are obtained with a combination of multiple approaches.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

2238,Defining the best combination of techniques to achieve the highest performance is an interesting direction of future work; our preliminary experiments combining Mean Teacher with manifold regularization have shown some improvements and we will include the results in the final version of the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,7,2
2239,"Second, with respect to novelty, we would like to re-iterate our contributions since they may not have been clear.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2240,"First, while manifold regularization has been explored in (Kumar et al 2017) and (Qi et al 2018), we proposed an efficient and effective approximation of manifold regularization that is far easier to compute than the involved method in (Kumar et al 2017).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2241,"Moreover, we point out issues with the standard finite difference approximation to the Jacobian regularization and propose a solution to this problem by ignoring the magnitude of the gradient and using only the direction information.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2242,"Moreover, we showed manifold regularization provides significant improvements to image quality and linked it to gradient penalties used for stabilizing GAN training, which were not shown by (Qi et al 2018).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2243,We did try to use spectral normalization but did not observe any gains for semi-supervised learning.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2244,"Finally we would like to emphasize the conceptual differences between our method and other smoothing methods like spectral normalization - such methods perform isotropic regularization, whilst ours performs anisotropic smoothing along the manifold directions of generated data-points.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2245,We showed through experiments using (isotropic) ambient regularization that anisotropic regularization is more beneficial in the case of semi-supervised learning.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2246,Regarding comment 1: Thanks for recognizing the merit of our idea.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2247,"As also mentioned by Reviewer #2, the proposed MAD implicitly assumes that classifiers in the competition are reasonably accurate.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2248,"Otherwise, the selected counterexamples may be less meaningful.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2249,We will make this assumption explicit in the revised manuscript.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
2250,"From this perspective (and other reasons mentioned in the discussion section), MAD should be viewed as complementary to, rather than a replacement for, the conventional accuracy comparison for image classification.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2251,"When two classifiers perform at a reasonable level and achieve very close accuracy numbers (e.g., VGG16BN and ResNet34 on ImageNet validation set), MAD provides the most efficient way of differentiating the two models by maximizing their discrepancies over a large-scale image set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2252,We want to emphasize that MAD is especially useful on image classification tasks where most cutting-edge classifiers achieve very close performance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2253,"In these situations, the MAD competition ranking, which is obtained by evaluating on corner examples searched from web-scale unlabeled dataset, is more convincing than something like 1% accuracy advantage on the validation set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2254,"For problem domains where there are few sufficiently accurate models, we may still apply the underlying principle behind MAD to create adaptive test sets such that the strengths and weaknesses of the models are most easily revealed.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2255,"In those scenarios, we conjecture that we need increase k to a reasonably larger number, thus at the cost of efficiency.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2256,Regarding comment 2: Thanks for the comment.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2257,"As long as two (or multiple) models differ (even in slightly different ways), MAD provides the highly efficient way of spotting such differences by exploring a large-scale unlabelled dataset.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2258,"However, these differences are less likely to be revealed using a fixed and small test set (i.e., they will probably have the same accuracy numbers as models to be compared are very similar and are biased in similar ways).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2259,"For the extreme case that two models are exactly the same (i.e, they are biased in identical ways and make identical prediction errors), both MAD and traditional accuracy-based methods will draw the same conclusion - the two models have the same performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2260,Accuracy-based evaluation methods arrive at this conclusion by comparing model predictions with ground truth labels and outputting the same accuracy numbers.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2261,"In contrast, MAD arrives at the same conclusion without any human labeling since the set S for subjective testing is empty.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2262,"So in this extreme case, both MAD and accuracy fail to compare those two models.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2263,"In summary, to reliably compare the relative performance of computational models, all evaluation methodologies (including MAD) rely on the assumption that the models to be compared should be diverse to a certain extent, and the proposed MAD makes this assumption more explicit.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2264,"In fact, MAD makes the best use of model discrepancies (even if models are biased in very similar but not identical ways) to rank the model performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2265,"As a matter of fact, based on our experiments, we find that state-of-the-art ImageNet classifiers do have their own biases. (See figure 8 in the appendix.)",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2266,Regarding comment 3: Thanks for the excellent question.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2267,We believe that the parameter k is task-dependent.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2268,"For problem domains where there are reasonably accurate models (e.g., imageNet classification in our example), we may obtain a stable ranking with a relative small k (e.g., k=15 in the imageNet classification example).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2269,"For problem domains where there are no good models, we may increase k to the limit of human labeling budget in order to obtain reasonable performance comparison.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2270,Regarding comment 4: Thanks for the comment.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2271,"In our current setting, we restrict the dataset D to the domain of interest that contain natural images of mainly 200 classes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2272,"However, as the construction of D is noisy and coarse, D contains plenty of open-set images, which do not belong to any class of interest.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2273,"Since we do not perform any manually data screening at this stage, some of the open-set images may even be selected to construct the dataset S.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2274,"This means that although the selected open-set image is out of the domain of interest, the associated two classifiers make different, high-confident (with threshold set to 0.8), but incorrect predictions (Case III).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2275,"As a result, we consider it as a strong counterexample of the two classifiers.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2276,"Note that this situation rarely happens, at least in our experiments because the competing classifiers tend to give open-set images low-confidence, and therefore are automatically filtered out.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2277,We agree with the reviewer that selecting images that contain only one salient object requires a lot of human effort.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2278,So we did not eliminate Case I. It turns out that keeping Case I does not seem to affect the comparison and analysis of competing models.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2279,We thank the reviewer for a detailed review.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2280,"We agree with the reviewer that a uniqueness result based on the axioms is desirable, but we don’t have it.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2281,"While we’re able to show that the paths at the input and at the hidden layer must be coupled (i.e. non-oblivious), we just don’t understand the space of non-oblivious methods that well.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2282,"Mathematically, we don’t have a handle on how the path at the hidden layer can vary as the network below the hidden layer is changed.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2283,"Partition consistency is the only axiom about the network below the hidden layer, but it is not applicable to all networks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2284,We probably need another axiom to prove uniqueness.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2285,Another key observation made by the reviewer is the interpretability vs importance of neurons.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2286,"While those are not the same, we demonstrate that conductance can give us some insights about the network (Sections 5.1 and 6.1).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2287,We thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback! We reply to the answers and comments in the order they were raised.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2288,"Note, that regarding the methodology there were some misunderstandings (which we try to avoid for future readers in the revised version).",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,7,2
2289,(1) The equations are indeed very related.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2290,"Note however, that In a standard Bayesian neural network (BNN), one would assume that \theta is a global random variable (i.e. does not depend on input x), whereas in the CDN, we assume that \theta depends on x and is thus a local random variable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2291,"Furthermore, in a Bayesian setting p(theta|...) would play the role of a approximate posterior, which would require variational inference (VI), and thus a different objective,  to estimate it.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2292,(2) In Equation (4) we followed with  p(D | \psi) a standard notation for \sum_n p(y_n | x_n; \psi) (i.e. summation of Equation (3) wrt all data in D) which also can be found e.g. in the work of Graves (2011) [4] and Blundell et al. (2015) [5].,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2293,"The objective we introduce for CDNs differs from the ELBO-based objective in VI in the way the logarithm is placed in the first term of the objective: in the ELBO we have a logarithm inside the expectation, while the logarithm is outside the expectation in the CDN objective (note however, that the sample-based approximations get equivalent if only one sample is used).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2294,"Furthermore, in the ELBO we have a fixed value of \lambda = 1.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2295,We added a new Section 4 in the revised version of the paper discussing these differences.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2296,"Moreover, we investigated the impact of the different objectives empirically and found that the CDN-based objective led to significantly better results, as shown in the newly added Section 6.4 in the revised manuscript.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2297,(3) Indeed we need the probabilistic version of hypernetworks to implement the model we described in Equation (3).,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2298,We just wanted to point out that this is in contrast to the vanilla  hypernetworks proposed by Ha et al. (2016) [1] and Jia et al.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2299,(2016) [2] which would produce a point estimate for \theta.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2300,(4) We used a matrix-variate normal (MVN) to reduce the parameters of the model.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2301,Using a diagonal MVN for X \in R^{p x q} one needs pq+p+q parameters.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2302,In contrast a fully-factorized diagonal Gaussian needs pq+pq.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2303,"But you are right, we could easily extend our approach to account for more flexible distributions by using a ""diagonal plus rank-one"" structure diag(a)+uu^T, with vectors a and u, as noted by Louizos and Welling ( 2016) [3] (the increase of parameters is negligible: adding additional vector u).",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2304,We will investigate the benefits of more flexible mixing distributions in future work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
2305,(5) Thanks for this valuable comment!,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,14,3
2306,We have revised the toy experiments to include a heteroscedastic regression task (see Section 6.1.).,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2307,It shows that CDNs are able to quantify the heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2308,"However, we kept the OOD experiments on MNIST and notMNIST in the paper as well, since we consider it as very interesting that the CDN, while being designed for modelling aleatoric uncertainty, is very competitive on this task.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2309,"Moreover, we investigate the mixing distribution learned in Appendix G.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2310,"(6) Of course, you are right! Previously we showed the test accuracy in Appendix F.  To make it more directly accessible, we have now added the test accuracy achieved by the different models into the legends of the plots, showing that CDN achieves similar predictive power as the baselines.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,5,3
2311,We now present the validation accuracy instead in Appendix F.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2312,"(7) Sorry, for this unfortunate formulation!",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
2313,"We observed that generally as \lambda increases, the uncertainty is increasing, while the accuracy is decreasing.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2314,Therefore a simple and effective heuristic for choosing \lambda is to look at the validation set of MNIST and choose the highest \lambda that still results in high accuracy (e.g. >. 0.97).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2315,We have made this procedure clear in the revised manuscript.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5

2352,>Can you elaborate more on why BatchNorm statistics are computed across all devices as opposed to per-device? Was this crucial for best performance?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

2428,We have updated A.6. to include the order of these parameters.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2429,"The specific choices of these parameters, like other similar problems, depend on some a priori unknown parameters (e.g. the sparsity k, and the incoherence mu) which makes some level of tuning unavoidable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2430,"This is true for Arora '15 and Mairal '09, as well, where tuning is required for the choice of step-size for dictionary update, and for choice of regularization parameter and the step-size for coefficient estimation via FISTA.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2431,"Note that, in our experiments we fix the step-size for FISTA as 1/L, where L is the estimate of the Lipschitz constant (since A is not known exactly).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2432,"Alternately, since NOODL involves gradient-based updates for the coefficients and the dictionary, tuning (the step-sizes and the threshold) is relatively straightforward in practice, since it is based on a gradient descent strategy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2435,", eta_A mostly effects the convergence rate as long as it is chosen in Theta(m/k).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2436,"Also, as shown in Table 4 (Appendix E), the tuning process for l1-based algorithms (i.e. FISTA) takes more time, since one needs to scan over the range of the regularization parameter to find one that works.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2437,"This (a) adds to the computational time, and (b) since the dictionary is not known exactly, may guarantee recovery of coefficients only in terms of closeness in l2-norm sense, due to the error-in-variables (EIV) model for the dictionary.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2466,We assumed that this is due to the vulnerability of neural networks [3] triggered by different distributions of pixel values between real and generated images.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8

2615,Our results show that exploration via curiosity has striking correlation with game scores.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2618,The purely curious agent learns to play the game better than agents trained to maximize the (clipped) extrinsic reward directly.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2629,1.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2630,The results of AA-pooling and F-pooling are not the same.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2631,"In Fig. 1, we show the results of average-pooling and F-pooling.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2632,"If you carefully look at the corner of curves, you can find the differences.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2633,"Without convolution, AA-pooling is similar to average-pooling (both of them are low-pass filters but with sightly different kernels.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2634,So AA-pooling gives different results for sine waves.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2635,"2. We believe F-pooling plays a more important rule in applications where shift-equivalent is serious, such as object detection and object tracking.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2636,Because we need to predict the location or shifts of an image object.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2637,"Moreover, F-pooling may be better for complex-valued CNNs, such as [1].",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2639,"In this way, the imaginary part is zero.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2661,Thank you very much for the constructive comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2662,We tried to strengthen our claims by adding more experimental data which the Reviewer requested.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,5,15
2663,"1. The proposed ""Multi-bit-quantization + Viterbi-based binary code encoding"" requires slightly larger memory footprint than ""Multi-bit quantization only ([4])"" because some of the Viterbi encoded bits have different indices from their corresponding quantization bits.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2664,"Hence, the ""Multi-bit quantization only"" requires 10 % to 20 % smaller memory footprint than ""Multi-bit-quantization + Viterbi-based binary code encoding"" case.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2665,"However, the main reason why we apply the Viterbi weight encoding is that parallel sparse-to-dense matrix conversion can be done by applying same Viterbi encoding process to the non-zero values and indices of the non-zero values in parallel.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2666,This parallel sparse-to-dense conversion makes the speed of feeding parameters to PEs 10 % to 40 % faster compared to [1] (Figure 6c).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2667,"2. Per Reviewer’s suggestion, the experimental results for the effectiveness of ""Don’t Care"" term have been moved to Section 4.1.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2668,"3. Per Reviewer's suggestion, we measured accuracy differences before and after Viterbi encoding for several quantization methods such as linear quantization ([2]), logarithmic quantization ([3]), and alternating quantization ([4]) methods with the same quantization bits (3-bit).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2669,The result shows that combination with alternating quantization and Viterbi weight encoding had only 2 % validation accuracy degradation after the Viterbi encoding was applied first right after the quantization and the accuracy was easily recovered with retraining.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2670,"On the other hand, the combination with the other quantization methods and Viterbi weight encoding showed accuracy degradation as much as 71 %, which was too large to recover the accuracy with retraining.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2671,The accuracy difference mainly results from the uneven weight distribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2672,"Because weights of neural networks usually are normally distributed, the composition ratio of '0' and '1' is not equal when the linear or logarithmic quantization is applied to the weights of neural networks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2673,"As we stated in the manuscript, Viterbi encoder tends to produce similar number of '0' and '1'.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2674,"Therefore, we can conclude that under the same bit condition, alternating quantization method shows best accuracy and compatibility with our bit-by-bit Viterbi encoding scheme regardless of the type of neural networks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2675,4. We conducted additional simulations to compare sparse matrix reconstruction speed of [1] and the proposed method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2676,We used a random 512-by-512 size matrix with various pruning rate ranging from 75 % to 95 %.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2677,We conducted the simulations under the assumptions described in Figure 6c.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2678,The simulation results are shown in Figure 6c in updated manuscript.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
2679,We could observe that the proposed method could feed 10 % to 40 % more nonzero weights and input activations to PEs in same 10000 cycles compared to [1].,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2680,"Proposed method could also feed parameters to PEs 20 % to 106 % faster compared to baseline method, which reads dense weight and activation matrices directly from DRAM.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2681,The improvement in the proposed scheme mainly comes from the parallelized process of assigning non-zero values to their corresponding indices in the weight matrix.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2682,"While preparing addition data for the rebuttal, we realized that our simulation model did not fully exploit the parallelized weight and index decoding process of the proposed method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2683,"After further optimization, we could observe that the parameter feeding rate of the proposed method increased compared to the reported data in original manuscript.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2710,We address the different remarks below.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2711,"“It is unclear whether the data augmentation techniques is applied only at training time or also at test time. In other words: at test time, do you present the original images only or transformed images too?”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2712,We apply the data augmentation both at training and test time.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2713,"“In section 4, it is unclear why only the maximal activation of the softmax layer is used to characterize a sample? Why not considering the full distribution that should contain richer information? Why just focusing on the output layer and why not using the info available at intermediate layers?”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2714,"We agree that the full distribution of the softmax layer provides more information, but there is no straightforward way to extend the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance to multi-dimensional distributions, beyond the two- and three-dimensional cases.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
2715,"We focus on confidence as a proxy to the loss, and we assume that the loss is the quantity that should be the most different between training and testing, as the optimization phase explicitly minimizes the loss on the training set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2716,"Moreover, early experiments showed that using the outputs of intermediate layers provide no improvement for membership inference (on preliminary CIFAR-10 experiments, we obtained respectively 67.7 accuracy with the output layer and 66.5 when using all layers).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2717,"“Section 5 is somewhat less clear than the previous sections. The authors should more clearly define what the private, public and evaluation sets are, right from the beginning. The purpose of the public set is explained only in section 5.2.”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2718,We will update this section to make it clearer.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2

2721,This seems to be too low to be of practical use.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2722,This might be because the Bayes and MAT attacks are too simplistic.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2723,"Again, why not using the distribution of the outputs of all layers? Why focusing only on the output of the last layer?”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

2725,"We emphasize that the last line of Table 3 corresponds to the most difficult setup, where the network has been trained with a strong data-augmentation, and we only use the intermediate layers of the network (which amounts to less than 62% of the parameters for e.g. Resnet101), this is why the performance is significantly impacted.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

2885,Thank you for your time and effort of reviewing our paper. Please see our response below.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14

2887,"(i) For single-layer random variables (RVs), we propose a unified gradient named GO by exploiting the integration-by-parts idea, which is applicable to continuous/discrete RVs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2888,"In the special case of single-layer continuous RVs where GO recovers Implicit Rep or pathwise gradients, we consider it’s our contribution to provide a principled explanation (via integration-by-parts) why Implicit Rep and pathwise gradients have low Monte Carlo variance; or in other words, we prove that their implicit differentiation originates from integration-by-parts.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2889,"(ii) For multi-layer RVs, our main contribution is the discovery that with GO (or in other words, the introduced variable-nabla), one can back-propagate gradient information through a nested combination of nonlinear functions and general RVs (including non-reparameterizable continuous RVs, back-propagating through which is challenging).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2890,Another interpretation of this contribution is that GO enables generalizing the deterministic chain rule to a statistical version.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2891,"Here, we refer to deterministic chain rule as back-propagating gradient through deterministic functions (like neural networks) or reparameterizable RVs (like Gaussian).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2892,"By contrast, statistical chain rule is referred to as back-propagating gradient through more general RVs (including non-reparameterizable ones).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2893,"Of course, statistical chain rule recovers deterministic chain rule for deterministic functions and reparameterizable RVs, because GO recovers the standard Rep.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2894,(iii) Another 2 minor contributions include Lemma 1 and Corollary 1.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2895,"In Lemma 1, we explicitly prove that our deep GO gradient contains the standard Rep as a special case, in general beyond Gaussian.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2896,"Note neither Implicit Rep nor pathwise gradients can recover Rep in general, because a neural-network-parameterized reparameterization usually leads to a nontrivial CDF.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2897,"In Corollary 1, we reveal the fact that the proposed method degrades into the classical back-propagation algorithm under specific settings.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2898,"Finally, we believe it is interesting to create a consistent architecture, which unifies (a) a GO gradient which contains many popular gradients as special cases, and (b) a more general statistical chain rule developed based on GO which recovers the well-known deterministic chain rule under specific cases.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

2906,Please note that what’s done in Secs. 4 and 5 is not straight-forward and has not been reported before.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
2907,"Since stochastic back-propagation (Rezende et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2015) focuses mainly on reparameterizable RVs, deterministic chain rule as mentioned in main contribution (ii) can be readily applied.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2908,"By contrast, we target towards more general situations in Secs. 4 and 5 where deterministic chain rule might not be applicable, such as for non-parameterizable (continuous) RVs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2909,"We prove that one can utilize our GO to sequentially back-propagate gradient though non-parameterizable continuous RVs, namely the statistical chain rule mentioned in main contribution (ii).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

2916,"Section 2 now formalizes our contribution of unifying Riemannian geometry and gyrovector spaces for all stereographic spaces of constant curvature of any sign, formally proving that the interpolation is smooth at 0.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2917,Please note that gyrovector spaces and their properties were stated only for negative curvature spaces prior to our work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

2921,It also gives the derivative of the distance function w.r.t. curvature around 0.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2922,"Theorem 4 describes two simple properties of our proposed left-matrix-multiplication, in particular that it is Mobius-scalar-associative.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2923,"Theorem 5 shows that our proposed left-matrix-multiplication is an intrinsic averaging for Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature, i.e. it does commute with isometries when the matrix A is right-stochastic, which is not the case of right-matrix-multiplication.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
2924,This is a desirable property for Riemannian averaging.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

2944,"Unfortunately, ICLR's tight schedule would prevent us to answer any additional questions after 15th of November. Thank you!",reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2945,We thank the reviewer for its valuable and insightful comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2946,We are reviewing our work from a theoretical point of view and will update the paper very soon to reflect this.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,2,5
2947,"Even though we have not yet proved the above, we have empirically showed that the benefit of DEBAL over plain ensemble methods consists of a better representation of uncertainty, that is paramount in active learning.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2948,By better we mean,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
2949,1) more meaningful and closer to what one would expect (Fig 4 & Fig 6 (right)),reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
2950,2) better calibrated (Fig 6 (left)).,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
2951,Our initial aim was not to compare stochastic ensembles with deterministic or single MC-dropout but to correct for the mode collapse issue in estimating posteriors with MC-dropout.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2952,"We have empirically shown that adding ensembles to this, greatly improves the MC-dropout technique and outperforms the deterministic ensembles as well.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2953,We had similar doubts about the benefit of adding MC-Dropout to an ensemble.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2954,"Therefore, we contrasted the performance of DEBAL against the plain ensemble method and showed empirically that DEBAL gives rise to better measures of uncertainty.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

2956,"For your final point, although Beluch et al. (2018) showed better performance for ensembles, we have shown this in the context of a small dataset problem (i.e. the size of the final dataset acquired during AL is only a small fraction of the entire available unlabelled dataset), which we believe is more relevant to the real world cases if AL is to become a widely used method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

2958,Thank you for your thoughtful review. We will address your concerns in turn.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2959,Q1: The idea is very related to Yeh et al.’s work which is not mentioned at all.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2960,A1: The entire first paragraph of our related work section is focused on Yeh et al.’s work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2961,"As we explained in the paragraph, there is a major theoretical flaw in their method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2962,Yeh et al. (2017) use the discriminator loss of a trained GAN as an indicator of how realistic their restoration is.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2963,"However, Goodfellow et al. (2014) already prove that the discriminator is unable to identify how realistic an input is after several steps of training, if the GAN has enough capacity.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2964,Ideally the generator will have all the information of the data distribution while the discriminator will have none.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2965,That is why we use the generator of a trained GAN as an implicit probability density model in our method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2966,"Another difference between their work and ours is that they only focus on image inpainting problem, while our method applies to various image restoration problems.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2967,Q2: Total variation regularization can also handle different degradations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
2968,A2: We think you underestimate the difficulty of those restoration problems.,reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,3,4
2969,Please check the degraded images in Table 3.,reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,15,4
2970,These images are damaged so badly that TV cannot recover any meaningful thing.,reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,1,4
2971,"As a handcrafted prior, TV performs much worse than our data-driven baseline method in these tasks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_contradict-assertion,4.0,1,4
2972,Q3: Does the proposed method learn the image inpainting mask as well?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2973,What are the parameters of the degradation in the applications?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2974,A3: The image inpainting mask is known and fixed.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2975,We use four different kinds of degradation to test the generality of our method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2976,"The first three kinds of degradation are 7× downsampling, making a 14×14 square hole in the center of the image, and adding Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation of 1.0, respectively.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2977,"The last kind of degradation is a composition of a series of degradation in order, which are (a) adding linear motion blur by at most 14 pixels in any direction, (b) 4× downsampling, (c) adding uniform noise between -0.05 and 0.05, (d) randomly removing 10% of the pixels.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2978,"Q: ""...I find these assumptions too strong for the task of learning disentangled representation.""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2979,A: We wish to emphasize that:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2980,(1) we only require access to meta-labels on the source set,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2981,(2) our goal is not to find disentangled representations; Our goal is transferability so that we can learn on real data with minimal supervision.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2982,"Q: ""you can simply train a network to predict the canonicalizations by simple supervised learning""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2983,A: Finding the canonicaliers is not our goal.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2984,These are used as auxiliary constraints which guide representation learning and allow for latent data augmentation on our limited target data.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2985,"Specifically, predicting the factor values will not help us in manipulating the target samples (note the significant improvement we get by using the majority vote).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
2986,"Q: method needs to be compared with other representation learning methods such as jigsaw[1], colorization[2] and rotation[3].",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2987,"A: The suggested methods [1-3] are self-supervised methods using less information than the baselines we have included (for example, the AE+classifier baseline is trained on the same synthetic data with the same access to digit labels).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2988,We therefore expect that these methods will perform worse than our baselines.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2989,We have included  a comparison with method [3] (see general comment to all reviewers).,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
2990,We thank the reviewer for the comments and suggestions.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2991,We address points individually below:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
2992,1) The Higher-order Lipschitz condition is necessary for us to use the PL convergence guarantee.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2993,"This condition is similar to assumptions made in convex optimization, especially where higher-order updates are involved (see eg. Agarwal et al. 2017 and Bubeck et al. 2019).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2994,"If the iterates of the algorithm always have bounded norm (eg. due to constraints or regularization), then three-times differentiable functions will satisfy the Higher-order Lipschitz condition for our purposes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2995,"This is because it suffices for the condition to hold for only the iterates of the algorithm ($x^{(1)},x^{(2)},...$), rather than for all of $\mathbb{R}^d$.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2996,2) We thank the reviewer for this remark.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
2997,"We wanted $L_H$ to be defined for our theorem statements, but we can see how it is confusing as is. We will make it clear that $L_H$ is the smoothness parameter of $H$.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
2998,3) Theorem 3.4 holds in the broadest setting out of all of these results.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
2999,Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 have slightly tighter bounds for their respective settings.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

3001,"4) It is true that these results rely on the PL condition, and this is unavoidable for our current results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
3002,"The novel perspective in this paper is that we consider the PL condition on a different objective, namely the squared gradient norm, rather than on the game objective $g$. This perspective allows us to prove our new bounds, although we still require some nontrivial linear algebra.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3003,The PL condition also allows us to easily prove our stochastic HGD results.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3004,5) The 1/sqrt(2) should cancel out on both sides of the guarantee in Theorem 5.2 (and eg. in equation 68).,reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11

3039,"Of course, we can also measure the margin of each example using a fix-perturbation attack, for example PGD, by binary searching over the perturbation levels.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3040,"However, the computation cost will significantly increase.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3041,"Consider, for example, the CIFAR-10 dataset.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3042,"Since for our model, most margins fall within 10, so let’s assume the binary search range is 10 (for adversarially trained models this number will be much higher).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3043,"If we want to achieve a accuracy of 0.1, then we need at least 7 binary search steps.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3044,"In other words, the computation complexity increases by 7 times.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3045,"In fact, CW applies a similar binary search idea to achieve zero-confidence attack, and that is why its computation cost is high.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3046,"The above discussion is not saying that it is impossible to convert PGD to a zero-confidence attack efficiently, but it at least provides a perspective on why zero-confidence attack is challenging, and why the complexity reduction as well as accuracy improvement of MarginAttack is valuable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3047,"Although this is not the major focus of your comment, we would like to revisit the theorem assumptions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3048,"While there are nine assumptions, these assumptions are in fact more realistic than expected.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3049,"Take the convexity assumption, which you mentioned in your review, as an example.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3050,This assumption does not say that the constraint has to be convex.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3051,It only says that the constraint should not be ‘too concave’.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
3052,"In particular, the curvature of the of the decision should not exceed that of the L2 or L-infinity ball.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

3056,"As can be seen, the convexity assumption permits a wide variety of decision boundaries.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3057,Among the few cases that it does not permit is the case where the decision boundary bends more than the L2 ball does.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3058,"In this case, the critical point becomes a local maximum rather than a local minimum.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3059,The other assumptions are also more realistic than their names sound.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3060,The differentiability assumption does not stipulate that the constraint has to be differentiable.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3061,It actually permits countably infinite jump discontinuities.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3062,"The Lipchitz continuous assumption does not assume Lipchitz continuity everywhere, but only at x*. We are not saying that the assumptions are very loose, but they are realistic enough to shed some light on the actual convergence property of MarginAttack.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

3065,Q: Did you try applying the classification loss to both the encoded representation and the canonicalized representation at the same time?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3066,"A: Yes we did and interestingly, it didn't show improvement.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3067,"The results are reported in Appendix A, Table A1 in the row titled: ""Ours + classifier after"" and discussed in Section 4.2.4.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
3068,"Note that because the bypassed latent, z, is included along with the canonicalized latents, z_canon, the classifier is trained on both the original representation and the canonicalized representations together.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3069,"Q: For Figure 2, Did you try applying canonicalizations in different orders? Do they give the same results?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3070,"A: For our experiments, each training example was bypassed and canonicalized by four different transformations: C_1, C_2, C_1C_2, and C_2C_1.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3071,So latents are canonicalized in both possible orderings.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3072,We discuss this point at the bottom of page 4 after equation 6 and will further clarify.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,2,1
3073,"Q: Instead of trying to learn idempotency by gradient descent, you could try to parametrize the canonicalizations with a matrix X, such that C =  X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T. C will be idempotent (although restricted to be symmetric).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3074,There might be other constructions that are more efficient and less restrictive.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3075,A: Structuring the matrix to enforce properties like idempotency is definitely an interesting direction to explore in future work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
3076,"While not equivalent, as a first step towards this, we did try to examine different levels of idempotency enforcement.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3077,"First, at the reconstruction loss, since pairs of canonicalizers are applied in different order we enforce the the decoded results are similar.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3078,"However, adding a stricter enforcement of similar values before decoding only hurt performance, hinting that the suggested idea of enforcing idempotency at the strictest level may hurt performance further.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3079,Q: I'm not sure I understand the PCA figures. Can you please explain how the first principal component was used to generate them?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3080,"A: Treating a canonicalizer as a standard linear projection, we explore z - P*z which should contain only the factor of interest (intuitively it is the difference between a representation and a version of it stripped off of the specific factor so that the factor is isolated).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3081,Creating a set of such latent samples (here we took all examples to be of the same digit for visualization purposes) we ran PCA to get a dimension with the most significant variance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3082,"If the above mentioned assumption indeed holds, the font should be the only change in the set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3083,We order the samples according to that axis and plot them in a row from left to right.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3084,We see that indeed the font (bottom row) and angle (top row) present a good correlation with the value along the axis.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3085,"1- We briefly mentioned the way problem embedding with similarity metric is used in the recommendation system in this work, but here is more explanation on that.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3086,The most similar problem is not necessarily recommended to a student.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3087,"On a high level, if a student performs well on problems, we assume he/she performs well on similar problems as well, so we recommend a dissimilar problem and vice versa.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3088,"More specifically, we project the performance of students on problems they solved onto the problems that they have not solved.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

3091,"An evaluation on real students is presented in part 2 of the comment titled “Response to questions about Prob2Vec” on this page, and we observed that similar problems are more likely to be solved correctly at the same time or wrong at the same time.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3092,The math expressions are not ignored in our proposed Prob2Vec method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

3094,We both use math expressions and text to label problems with appropriate concepts.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3095,"2- Prob2Vec only uses expert knowledge for rule-based concept extractor, but does not use selected informative words.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3096,The effort put for rule-based concept extractor is negligible compared to effort needed for annotation of all problems with their corresponding concepts.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3097,We both annotated all problems manually and used rule-based concept extractor for annotation.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3098,"In the former method, we observed 100% accuracy in the similarity detection test and observed 96.88% accuracy in the latter method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3099,"However, the rule-based concept extractor needs much less manual effort than manual problem annotation and is capable to provide us with relatively high level of accuracy we need in our application.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3100,"Note that our method is scalable as long as problems are in the same domain as the rule-based concept extractor is automated for a single domain, but for the case that problems span many different domains, it is the natural complexity of the data set that requires a more sophisticated rule-based concept extractor.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3101,"Furthermore, in most realistic cases for education purposes, problems span a single domain not multiple ones.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

3168,We address these concerns one-by-one.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3169,a. Limited contribution to the qualitative understanding of the optimizers:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3170,"We consider the three main contributions of our work to be 1) a systematic evaluation protocol of optimizers, with off-the-shelf HPO to account for the cost of tuning of hyperparameters.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3171,"This is missing in existing papers, which consider best attained performance alone.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3172,"The importance of a proper hyperparameter search protocol is emphasized by Choi et al., 2019 (published after our submission and under review at ICLR).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3173,"2) a “w-tunability” measure of the cost of hyperparameter optimization, and 3) under the experiments considered we find that Adam (with default beta and epsilon values) is the most tunable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3174,a.i. Informativeness of the tunability metric:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3175,"We propose w-tunability as a metric to incorporate the HPO tuning too in reporting the performance of an optimizer, and compute it as a linear combination of the incumbents of the HPO algorithm, though one can use an arbitrarily complex function trading off interpretability.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3176,It is true that Figures 4-7 essentially contain all the information needed to judge about the optimizer’s tunability.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
3177,"However, a metric that is easy to compute, interpret and compare optimizers across tasks is crucial, for which we propose w-tunability.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3178,"This is analogous to computing specific quantities like accuracy, FPR, TPR from the confusion matrix, even though a confusion matrix contains all the information (and is quite cumbersome to compare).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3179,"The summary metric in Figure 2 provides a different interpretation: It reports a normalized performance i.e., the  normalized incumbent performance at iteration $k$. This doesn’t explicitly include information about the previous $k-1$ iterations (which is our central argument).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

3317,"To reply to your other specific comments,",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3318,1) The intuition for batchnorm can be put in a more general setting.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3319,"If a function f: X -> Y tends to spread out small clusters in the input space almost evenly in the output space, then one can expect that its gradients will be large typically.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3320,"In our case, a batchnorm network can be understood as a function that sends a batch of inputs to a batch of outputs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3321,"In the appendix, we showed that the correlation between two different batches tend to a constant value independent of the input batches.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3322,"No matter how close two input batches are, the output batches will have the same “distance” from each other -- small movements in the input space leads to large movements in the output space.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3323,Thus we can expect the gradients to be large as well.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3324,We have added a new figure to the Appendix to further support this intuition.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1

3329,We observe that deep networks whose activation statistics resemble a non-BSB1 fixed point typically feature worse gradient explosion than BSB1 networks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3330,"This seems to be because the nonlinearities that induce these fixed points increase rapidly (for example, polynomials with high degrees), so that the corresponding derivatives are also large, causing gradient explosion.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3331,"(The reason that rapidly increasing nonlinearities don’t converge to BSB1 fixed points is that, after a spontaneous symmetry-breaking, begins a “winner-take-all” covariance dynamics, in which the activations of a few examples in the batch suddenly dominates those of the others in the batch, and this dominance persists across each layer.)",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

3504,"The improvement over this baseline is 0.61 in [2], 0.8 in [3] (1.3 BLEU improvement over the re-implemented 27.9 baseline in [3]) and 0.9 in [4], while ours is 1.65 BLEU score.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3505,"(2) The baselines: As we explained in the previous response, we are using the state-of-the-art transformer as our backbone model, and comparing against all the relevant algorithms including KD, BT and the traditional 2-agent dual learning (Dual-1).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

3515,We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful review.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
3516,The reviewer points out that CNE works well for link prediction and visualization.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3517,We wish to point out that our experiments indicate CNE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art not only for these tasks but also for multi-label classification.,reb_fine,rebuttal_accept-praise,0.0,3,0
3518,Our responses:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3519,"a) Variational inference is useful in particular when the partition function is hard to compute, which is not the case here.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3520,So we believe it would be overkill in this case.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3521,"In any case, it is not needed to achieve the performances CNE achieves at a very modest computational complexity and fast practical runtimes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3522,b) No hand-engineering is needed to use CNE even when using more informative priors modeling node degrees and block structure.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3523,"The degree of each node can simply be computed on the training set, so no hand-engineering is needed (just the choice to include it or not -- and it always better to include it).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3524,"The block structure, on the other hand, will often be part of the data specification or meta-data of the nodes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3525,"For example, the network may be a multi-partite network representing a relational database, or it may be a company social network where the nodes are employees, and generic job titles are known for each of the employees (as attributes of the nodes).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3526,"The entity types in the first example, and the job titles in the second example, would then define the blocks, and the density of the parts of the adjacency matrix between any two such blocks can again easily be computed on the network.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3527,Our method imposes no constraints on such blocks (e.g. they may even be partially overlapping).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3528,"Again, all that is needed is choosing whether to use a block prior for any specified attribute (in the two examples: entity type, and node attribute).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3529,"Again, empirically, including it always appears to be better, so one could even avoid having to make the choice.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3530,"Inferring structural properties of the graph to be used in the prior (e.g. using GraphRNN), as we understand the reviewer suggests, certainly sounds potentially interesting.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3531,"However, while it may improve accuracy, we do not believe that it adds value in reducing the amount of hand-engineering needed, as the amount of hand-engineering needed is very minimal already.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3532,"The fact that CNE could be combined with such inferred structural properties increases its potential impact though, and this remark of the reviewer further underscores the need for methods such as CNE that can take such structural information into account.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3533,"The boost in accuracy achieved by CNE, using a model that is arguably also a lot simpler than the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, is thus achieved without any increased need for hand-engineering.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3534,Thank you for the insightful review.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
3535,We updated the paper with better results and more tasks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,5,14
3536,We show that our method outperforms the human baseline in terms of training speed and either matches or outperforms the human in terms of final accuracy on all tasks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3537,"While it is true that the human baseline does not require any additional computational resources for training, it does require domain expertise acquired through years of learning, which is arguably even more costly.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
3538,"Notably, in all 4 problems where we compare to the human baseline, we believe that human researchers used a similar or higher number of runs as our tuner to design the baseline schedules that we compare against.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

3549,We are glad that you found our experiments extensive and that our approach provides significant improvements.,reb_fine,rebuttal_accept-praise,0.0,14,0
3550,"In response to your comment that ""similar ideas have been undertaken (e.g., Mescheder et al 2018), but in different contexts"" we would like to take this opportunity to clarify the novelty of our approach.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3551,"First, with regards to (Mescheder et al 2018), our method is not simply the application of existing gradient penalties (GPs) in the context of semi-supervised learning.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3552,"Our approach is conceptually different since the regularizer proposed by (Mescheder et al 2018) is an (isotropic) ambient regularizer in the input space, whereas the regularizer we used performs (anisotropic) smoothing on the manifold parametrized by the latent generative model.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3553,We believe we are the first to show the benefits of anisotropic Jacobian regularizers in the context of semi-supervised learning.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3554,"Moreover, an important contribution of our work is the efficient computation of such gradient penalties in the context of semi-supervised learning.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3555,"Current application of such penalties uses the exact Jacobian which is especially computationally expensive in the case of semi-supervised learning as it is now a tensor (one matrix per class in the case of Improved GAN), which quickly becomes intractable with large numbers of classes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3556,We proposed and demonstrated the effectiveness of an efficient (non-obvious) approximation of the Jacobian-based regularizer which significantly accelerates training.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
3557,We provide responses to further questions/comments below:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3558,"Q: ""A comparison with Graph Convolutional Network based techniques seems appropriate (e.g. Kipf and Welling 2017).""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3559,A: Methods such as (Kipf and Welling 2017) are designed for semi-supervised learning on graphs; here a key challenge is in defining the structure (edges and edge weights) of the graph.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
3560,Defining the graph structure is not trivial for the image datasets commonly used as benchmarks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
3561,"In this light, one of the advantages of our approach is that the manifold (graph structure) is implicitly learned by the GAN, thus avoiding the need to explicitly define it.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
3562,"That said, it is an interesting direction for future work and we thank the reviewer for the suggestion.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
3563,"Q: ""How do the FID/Inception improvements compare to (Mescheder et al 2018)?""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3564,"A: We cannot directly compare our image generation scores with those reported in (Merscheder et al 2018) as we used different GAN architectures; for reference, they reported an Inception score of 6.2.",reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11
3565,"We have updated the paper with Inception/FID scores from the ambient regularizer on CIFAR-10 (Table 4), which is an approximation of the proposed regularizer in (Merscheder et al. 2018) using stochastic finite differences.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
3566,"As mentioned earlier, it is not practical to compare the non-approximated regularizer due to the substantial increase in computational complexity in the semi-supervised GAN setting.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
3567,We observe that ambient regularization gives better image generation scores; however it does not perform as well on semi-supervised learning.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3568,"This tradeoff between image generation and semi-supervised learning performance was previously reported in (Salimans et al., 2016) ""Improved Methods for Training GANs"".",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

3574,"Q: ""More analysis should be provided on why (Kumar et al 2017) perform so well on SVHN.""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3575,"A: We note that although on average the method of (Kumar et al 2017) performs better on SVHN, the standard deviation is also much higher than many other methods (including ours) on both SVHN and CIFAR-10 indicating that it is not as robust.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

3835,"We meant to say that in network embedding methods that aim to model first-order proximity (where proximity in the embedding space implies a higher probability of being linked), this is a requirement (otherwise, proximity of v and v' would imply they are likely to be linked).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3836,Thus our argument only applies to such first-order proximity methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3837,"Methods that aim to model second-order proximities (where proximity in the embedding space implies a greater overlap between the sets of adjacent nodes), however, are similarly vulnerable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

3848,"We have however summarized the relevant aspects: the fact that all probabilities P_ij, although there are n^2 of them, can be represented using much fewer parameters, and the fact that they can be fitted highly efficiently (in our experiments, even on the largest networks, this always took only a tiny proportion of the total computation time).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

3878,1). Low-rank assumption:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
3879,"This work was primarily motivated by the observation that many systems exhibit strong relationship among states and actions, governed by potentially simple dynamics.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3880,This might eventually lead to structures within the optimal solution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3881,We hope that this empirical study would motivate further theoretical analysis on structures within the community.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,14,1
3882,Below are some thoughts on the potential theoretical motivation for this assumption:,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
3883,a) It is possible that the states and actions in consideration have some latent variable representations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3884,"If the optimal Q function is a piecewise analytic function on the latent variables, then there are works arguing the approximately low-rank property of the resulting matrix [1].",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3885,"b) There are theoretical works in RL and Markov process that assume that the transition kernel can be decomposed to a low-dimensional feature representation [2,3].",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3886,These assumptions on the transition kernel may lead to low-rank optimal Q matrices.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3887,"c) For continuous problems, theoretical analysis often needs to assume some sort of smoothness in the Q function [4,5].",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

3898,"At each step, for the submatrix, one could randomly sample a portion of the entries for ME, while keeping another fraction of the remaining entries as a validation set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3899,"If the recovered matrix via ME has a low reconstruction error on the validation set, it is likely that a suitable low-rank approximation is sufficient and has been found by the ME oracle.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
3900,"In contrast, if the reconstruction error is large, the algorithm might have been too aggressive on finding a low-rank solution while a higher rank solution is indeed necessary.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4281,This means that for a single alt-az rotation of input spherical image; the output of a convolution layer will rotate in the same way.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4282,"Although the property doesn’t hold if one performs multiple alt-az rotations to the input spherical image, it is still valuable because we assume the different SO(3) orientation of an input 3D shape is from a composite of an azimuthal rotation and an alt-az rotation, the azimuthal rotation is treated by data augmentation and the single alt-az rotation is treated by the network equivariance and invariance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4283,Q3: alt-az convolution is not well defined on the south pole,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4284,"A3: Yes, we agree that our original definition of alt-az convolution is not well defined on both north and south poles.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
4285,"Therefore, in the new revision, we will add the constraints to the definition of alt-az rotation and make it one-to-one corresponds to the set points on $S^2$. See A1.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,2,5
4286,Q4: The paragraph motivating the alt-az convolution on page 4 is not very clear.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
4287,"A4: Thanks for the comments, as you suggested, we will rewrite this paragraph in the new version, and acknowledge the importance and effectiveness of the recent work on the group equivariance and rotation invariant networks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4288,"Q5: It would be nice to see a more direct comparison between the three definitions of spherical convolution (general SO3, isotropic S2, and anisotropic S2)",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4289,"A5: The two related papers (Cohen et al 2018 for general SO3 and Esteves, and Esteves et al 2018 for isotropic S2) both use lat-lon grid and Fourier domain convolution, while ours uses a icosahedron-sphere grid and direct spherical domain convolution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4290,"The use of different sampling in the input spherical image, and the use of filters are totally different.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4291,We think a direct comparison should be done in one of the following ways : (a) perform the three types of spherical convolution all using icosahedron-sphere grid and then convolve in the spherical domain.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4292,(b) perform the three types of spherical convolution all using lat-lon grid and convolve in the Fourier domain.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4293,"For the first type of direct comparison, to implement isotropic spherical convolution (Type II), we should make the geodesic disc filter share an identical weight along the angular direction.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4294,"To implement a general SO(3) spherical convolution, we should add a rotation degree of freedom into our disc filter.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4295,"We are conducting this experiment and if the time and paper page limit are allowed, we will report the comparison result in the revised version.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,2,1
4296,"Otherwise, we will put it into our future work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
4297,"For the second type of direct comparison, we need to conduct alt-az spherical convolution in the Fourier domain, this is possible by determining the spherical harmonic coefficient, $<g_0, Y_l^m> $ for the alt-az convolution in terms of the spherical harmonic coefficient of input spherical signal $f$ and the filter $h$. This comparison needs re-designing of our network and we can not finish it within the rebuttal period, we’ll leave it for future work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4298,"Q6: Initially, I was a bit puzzled about why SO(3) augmentation seems to reduce accuracy in table 1.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
4299,I think this is because SO(3) augmentation actually makes the classification problem harder if the input is initially aligned.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
4300,Some more explanation / discussion would be good.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
4301,"A6: Theoretically, our method will be rotation invariant with only AZ rotation, it will be full rotation invariant with SO(2) rotation augmentation about an arbitrary axis .",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4302,"In table I, we believe the reason alt-az augmentation performs better because it contains more training data.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4303,SO(3) augmentation underperforms the AZ augmentation because several random SO(3) rotation augmentation might not be able to cover all the relative rotation wrt the filter's orientation (see appendix).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4304,Q7: It would be nice to explain the spherical parameterization in more detail.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4305,Is this operation itself rotation equivariant?,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
4306,"A7: Due to the page limit of the conference paper, we could not explain the spherical parameterization method in detail.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,1,7
4307,This operation is theoretically rotation equivariant.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4308,Spherical parameterization establishes a map that transforms the points of a closed surface into the points on the unit sphere.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4309,A good spherical mapping for a closed surface should satisfy the following properties:bijective mapping and least distortion.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4310,"Bijective mapping is the most important but most difficult in this process which implies that the resulting map is one-to-one, fold-free, and therefore feature preserving (information lossless).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4311,Least distortion seeks a good sampling rate such that interesting features of the model receive enough real estate on the sphere in order to be accurately sampled.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4312,We achieved the bijective mapping by adapting a coarse-to-fine strategy with minor modifications (See http://hhoppe.com/proj/sphereparam/).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4313,The minimizing of the map distortion is obtained using the authalic parameterization proposed in Sinha et al 2016.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4314,This process is rotation equivariant because the initial bijective mapping is depends on the object orientation and the authalic remeshing does not change the orientation of the spherical embeddings.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4315,"Spherical parameterization is a good way to retain geometric and topological information of original shapes (compared to the spherical projection method), but currently it works only for genus-0 closed object, extending it to 3d shapes with arbitrary topology is still an unsolved problem, that is why we could not adapt this method for dataset such as ModelNET and Shrec’17, they contain 3D objects with arbitrary topology.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4320,Please let us know if we have missed other papers.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4321,Your proposal of combining multiple extant problem sets is a good idea.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4322,"We’d want to ensure the combined datasets have a common format (e.g., the same unambiguous freeform text format for reasons of transferability, etc as argued in the paper), and there are interesting problem types occurring in other datasets (such as logical entailment or boolean satisfiability) that we haven’t yet included.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
4323,"We may in the future extend the dataset to include these other problem types if the current ones become solved, and of course we solicit contributions (in the form of generation code) to the dataset.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
4324,"We likely could not use workbooks etc as a source for problems without significant investment, since obtaining legal permission to redistribute copyrighted problems found in these books would probably be hard and/or expensive.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
4325,"Having said that, it is definitely important to ensure the problems remain grounded in real-life problems (thus our small list of real-life exam questions).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4326,"This was the motivation for testing trained models against “real life” questions occurring in school-level examinations; these questions are not intended to be a primary benchmark (with more questions and detailed grades), but rather simply a rough indication of whether training models to answer school-level questions could be achievable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4327,"On the distribution of the sampled answer (and the related question of how difficulty levels are determined), these are great questions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4328,"For some modules with two output choices (e.g., True, False), we can simply split the answers 50-50.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4329,"But in general, the answer distribution depends on the module, with hand-tuning to ensure the (question, answer) pair is of a reasonable difficulty level as judged by humans.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4330,"In more detail: as mentioned in the paper, we want to achieve upper bounds on the maximum probability that any single (question, answer) is sampled; thus if we sample the answer from a set of N possible answers, then to achieve a maximum probability p of a given question, the remaining choices made in generating the question must",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4331,"be from a set of size p/N. We roughly aim to pick N (depending on p) so that conditioned on this, the question is as easy as possible; there is typically a hand-tuned sweet spot.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4332,"On evaluating general-purpose models only, we may have phrased this badly in the paper, and have updated it.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
4333,"We are definitely interested in any models that learns to do mathematics and symbolic reasoning, which would include more sophisticated models tailored towards doing mathematics (one could imagine models with working memory, etc).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4334,"However, we discount models that already have their mathematics knowledge inbuilt rather than learnt (for example, this includes many of the models that occur in algebraic reasoning tasks, where the model learns to map the input text to an existing equation template, that is then solved by a fixed calculator).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4335,"We test DNC (differentiable neural computers) and RMC (relational memory core) models, which arguably are more specialized for doing mathematics, since they have a slot-based memory that may be appropriate for storing intermediate results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4336,"However these models obtained worse performance than the more general architectures, and we are not yet aware of models that are more tailored for doing mathematics that do not simply have their mathematics knowledge built-in and unlearnable; we hope the dataset will spur the development of new models along these lines.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4337,"On the number of thinking steps, in our earlier analysis we trained up to 150k steps (compared with 500k for final performance reported in paper), and observed the following interpolation test performances by number of steps: 39% (0 steps), 46% (1 step), 48% (2), 49% (4), 50% (8), 51% (16).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4341,We address all your concerns in the revision as below.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4342,Q1: Was the auxiliary tower used during the training of the shared weights W?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

4350,"As show in Figure 4, all the operators in level 4 are pruned.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
4351,Q4: “The sparse regularization of \lambda induces great difficulties in optimization”,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4352,A4: The non-smooth regularization introduced by l1 regularization makes traditional stochastic SGD failed to yield sparse results.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4353,"If we need exact zero, we have to use heuristic thresholding on the \lambda learned, which has already been demonstrated in SSS [1] that is inferior.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4354,"Besides, traditional APG method is not friendly for deep learning as extra forward-backward computation is required, also as shown by SSS.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4355,"Q5: “Missed citation: MnasNet also incorporates the cost of architectures in their search process. On ImageNet, your performance is similar to theirs. I think this will be a good comparison.”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4356,A5: We have added the result of MnasNet [2] in Table 2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
4357,"Indeed, MnasNet achieves similar results with us with less FLOPs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
4358,"However, it is also need to note that MnasNet evaluates more than 8K models, which introduces much higher search cost than our method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
4359,"Moreover, the design space of MnasNet is significant different from other existing NAS methods including ours.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
4360,It is interesting to explore the combination of MnasNet with ours in the future work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7

4372,Thank you for pointing out a related preprint by Z. Hu et al. [arXiv:1905.13728].,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4373,"We note the work by Z. Hu et al. was developed independently and concurrently to our work here, and we were not aware of it at the time of writing our paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
4374,We shall cite the preprint and include a discussion in our paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4375,"Briefly, the key difference between our work and that of Hu et al. is that Hu et al. consider a more restrictive setting where graphs are completely unlabeled (i.e., graphs have no node features).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4376,Hu et al. then focus on extracting generic graph properties of unlabeled graphs by pre-training on randomly-generated graphs.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4377,"While the approach is interesting, the limitation of such an approach is that it improves performance only marginally over ordinary supervised classification of the original attributed graphs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4378,This is because it is hard for random unlabeled graphs to capture domain-specific knowledge that is useful for a specific application.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4379,"Moreover, in practice, graphs tend to have labels together with rich node and edge attributes, but Hu et al.’s approach cannot naturally leverage such attribute information, which then results in limited gains.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4380,"In principle, we could compare our approach against Hu et al., however, right now, this would be extremely challenging because of the following reasons.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4381,(1) We cannot find a public implementation of Hu et al.’s approach for reliable comparison.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4382,"(2) Reimplementing their method requires knowledge of many specific implementational details and design choices (feature extraction, graph generation, etc.), which are not discussed in their preprint.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4383,"(3) Finally, their pre-trained GNN operates on unlabeled graphs, and so it cannot be directly applied to our datasets of labeled graphs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4384,"Lastly, in contrast to Hu et al., our work focuses on important real-world domains, where one wants to pre-train GNNs by utilizing the abundant graph, node, and edge attributes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4385,"Importantly, our approach is able to learn a domain-specific data distribution that is useful for downstream prediction.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4386,"We demonstrate on two application domains that such practical settings (i.e., labeled graphs with naturally-given node and edge attributes) are very important to consider and that our pre-training can substantially improve model performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4387,We thank Reviewer 3 (R3) for their review and for clearly articulating their concerns regarding the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4388,"In our response below, we will clarify the design and results of our experiments as well as argue why we believe that these results should be of interest and are not, indeed, that predictable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
4389,R3 asked why training performance of many models is 100% when they do not generalize and suggested us to perform a large number of training runs to see if occasionally the right solution is found.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4390,"First, we agree that from the point of view of training there are many equally good solutions, and in fact, this is the main and the only challenge of SQOOP.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
4391,"We designed the task with the goal of testing which models are more likely to converge to the right solution, with which they can handle all possible combinations of objects, despite being trained only on a small subset of objects.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4392,We argued extensively in the introduction that such an ability to find the systematic solution despite other alternatives being available is highly desirable for language understanding approaches.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4393,"We fully agree with R3 that in investigations of whether or not a particular model converges to the right solution repeating every experiment several times is absolutely necessary, and we would like to emphasize that we did repeat each experiment 3, 5, or 10 times (see “details” in Table 1 and the paragraph “Parametrization Induction” on page 8).",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,3,5
4394,"In most cases we saw a consistent success or consistent failure, one exception being the parametrization induction results, where 4 out of 10 runs were successful (see Table 4, row 1 for the mean and the confidence interval).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4395,"We hope that 3 takes this fact into account, and we will furthermore improve on the current level of rigor in the upcoming revision by repeating each experiment at least 5 times.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4396,We are not sure if we fully understand the question “Could you somehow test for if a given trained model will show systematic generalization?” that R3 asked.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4397,We test the systematic generalization of a model by evaluating it on all SQOOP questions that were not present in the training set.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4398,We hope that this answers the question of R3 and we would be happy to engage in a further discussion regarding this and make edits to the paper if necessary.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4399,We thank R3 for the suggestion to investigate the influence of model size and regularization on systematic generalization.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4400,"It is indeed a very appropriate question in the  context of our study, however, we note that there exists a wide variety of regularization methods and trying them all (and all their combinations) would be infeasible.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
4401,"In the upcoming update of the paper we will report results of an on-going ablation study for the MAC model, in which we vary the module size, the number of modules and experiment with weight decay.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4402,We would welcome any other specific experiment requests R3 may have.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4403,"Finally, we would like to discuss the significance of our investigation and its results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4404,While we agree that the results that we report may not shock the reader (although perhaps hindsight bias plays a role in what people find surprising or not after reading an article) we find them highly interesting and not at all easily predictable.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
4405,"Reading prior work on visual reasoning may lead a researcher to conclude, roughly speaking, that NMNs are a lost cause, since a variety of generic models perform comparably or better.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4406,"In contrast, our rigorous investigation highlights their strong generalization capabilities and relates them to the specific design of NMNs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4407,"Notably, chain-structured NMNs were used in the literature prior to this work (e.g. in the model of Jonshon et al multiple filter_...[...] modules are often chained), so the fact that tree-structured NMNs show much stronger generalization was not obvious prior to this investigation and should be of a high interest to the research community.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4408,"Last but not least, an important part of our investigation (which the review does not discuss) is the systematic generalization analysis of popular end-to-end NMN versions, that shows how making NMNs more end-to-end makes them more susceptible to finding spurious solutions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4409,"As we argued in our conclusion, these findings should be of a highest importance to researchers working on end-to-end NMNs, which is a very popular research direction nowadays.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

4411,"We are currently performing a lot of additional experiments, the results of which will make our investigation even more rigorous and complete.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4412,We sincerely hope that R3 takes into account the arguments we have made here and the new results that we will publish soon and reevaluates our paper more positively.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14

4417,"In particular, we report that NMN-Chains (with a lot of inductive bias built-in and also used in prior work such as Johnson et al. 2017) generalize poorly compared to even generic modules, and that layout/parameterization induction often fails to converge to the correct solution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
4418,We believe both these findings are quite surprising.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

4424,We are glad that you found the paper well-contextualized and the presentation high-quality. Here we discuss some of your comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4425,"R2: ""this 'finishes' [Pathak et al., ICML17] to its logical conclusion for game-based environments and should spur interesting conversations and further research. In terms of actual technical contributions, I believe much less significant.""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

4427,This is a novel contribution since prior works have relied on learned features as a crucial requirement for good performance [Pathak et. al. ICML17].,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4428,We believe this investigation would allow random features to be seen as an easily reproducible and strong baseline for future investigations of feature learning in exploration.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4429,"Indeed, since the release of our paper, there has been some follow-ups on using random features for exploration in achieving state of the art results on hard exploration games when combined with extrinsic reward (in the interest of preserving anonymity, we don't include the references here).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

4727,"On the other hand, as mentioned by the other reviewer, distortion is usually not that essential in adversarial attacks as long as it is maintained in a reasonable range.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4728,"We could actually remove the distortion column, instead, we chose to include it just to show that we did not trade a lot of distortions (to make problem much easier) and thus gains speedup.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4737,Better time complexity of adversarial attack could significantly speed up adversarial training algorithms.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4738,"Second, it is worth noting that the running time complexity of adversarial attack also highly depends on the input size.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4739,"For example, if you attack a CIFAR-10 classifier or an MNIST classifier, it could take only seconds per attack even for the slowest algorithm since the input size is only 32 by 32 (or 28 by 28).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4740,"However, if you attack a ImageNet classifier or even higher dimensional data classifier, it could take significantly longer time (minutes).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4770,1. You are right that Frank-Wolfe would be advantageous over PGD when the constraints are more complicated and adversarial attack may not be such a case.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
4771,Yet it is also well-known that Frank-Wolfe has quite different optimization behavior compared with PGD even though they have the same order of convergence rate.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4772,"Therefore, it is interesting and important to examine the performance of Frank-Wolfe algorithm for adversarial attack, given the fact that PGD has been shown to be a very effective for adversarial attack.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4800,- Relationship to z-conditioning strategy in BigGAN.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4801,Thanks for pointing out the connection to this concurrent submission.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4802,We will discuss the connections in the related work section.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,2,14
4803,The main differences are as follows:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4804,"1. BigGAN performs conditional generation, whilst we primarily focus on unconditional generation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4805,"BigGAN splits the latent vector z and concatenates it with the label embedding, whereas we transform z using a small MLP per layer, which is arguably more powerful.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4806,"In the conditional case, we apply both additive and multiplicative interaction between the label and z, instead of concatenation as in BigGAN.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4807,2. Overall BigGAN focusses on scalability to demonstrate that one can train an impressive model for conditional generation.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4808,"Instead, we focus on a single idea, and show that it can be applied very broadly.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4809,We provide a thorough empirical evaluation across critical design decisions in GANs and demonstrate that it is a robust and practically useful contribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4810,- Propagation of signal and ResNets.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4811,"Indeed, ResNets provide a skip connection which helps signal propagation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4812,"Arguably, self-modulation has a similar effect.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4813,"However, there are critical differences in these mechanisms which may explain the benefits of self-modulation in a resnet architecture:",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
4814,1. Self-modulation applies a channel-wise additive and multiplicative operation to each layer.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4815,"In contrast, residual connections perform only an element-wise addition in the same spatial locality.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4816,"As a result, channel-wise modulation allows trainable re-weighting of all feature maps, which is not the case for classic residual connections.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4817,"2. The ResNet skip-connection is either an identity function or a learnable 1x1 convolution, both of which are linear.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4818,"In self-modulation, the connection from z to each layer is a learnable non-linear function (MLP).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4819,"- Reading Figure 2b, one could be tempted to draw a correlation between the complexity of the dataset and the gains achieved by self-modulation over the baseline (e.g., Bedroom shows less difference between the two approaches than ImageNet).

4821,These datasets also have more headroom for improvement.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4822,"1. I feel the approach to implicitly assume that the classifiers to be compared are already ""reasonably accurate""; since if not, both classifiers might be easily falsified by certain trivial examples, making the ""disagreed examples"" not as meaningful. If that is true, I would suggest the authors to make this hidden assumption clearer in the paper",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4823,Response: Thanks for the constructive suggestion. We agree with the reviewer and will make this assumption explicit in the revised manuscript.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4824,"2. The idea shows clear liaison to the ""differential testing"" concept in software engineering besides the cited work of perceptual quality assessment.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4825,The idea has a cross-disciplinary nature and is fairly interesting to me.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

4828,"3. One minor comment: for images in ""Case III"", the authors considered them ""contribute little to performance comparison between the two classifiers"" and therefore did not source labels for them.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4829,"However, since the authors adopted an affinity-aware distance, two incorrect predictions can still be compared based on their semantic tree distances to the true class.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
4830,Response: Thanks for pointing it out.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4831,We agree with the reviewer that images falling into Case III can be used to distinguish the associated two classifiers using the proposed semantic tree distance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
4832,We will revise the writing to make it more rigorous.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4833,"In our current subjective assessment environment, we choose to stop labeling images in Case III because it is difficult for humans to select one among 200 classes, especially when they are unfamiliar with the class ontology.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4838,2) Hyperparameter selection,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4839,The reviewer is completely right that we are removing one hyperparameter by introducing another.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
4840,"However, there are two reasons why this might still be beneficial: one is that the penalty coefficient is now effectively dynamic and can change during training, ensuring higher chances of finding a good solution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4841,"Second, by elevating the hyperparameter one level up, we hope that the learning is indeed less sensitive to its specific setting.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4842,"Indeed, we found in practice that we get similar results for \beta within some orders of magnitude, which requires significantly less tuning compared to a fixed \alpha.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4843,3) Relation to safe reinforcement learning,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4844,It is indeed the case that constrained MDPs are often considered in safe RL.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4845,"In those cases there is generally an upper bound on a penalty function that should never be exceeded, including during training itself.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4846,These algorithms generally restrict policy updates to remain within the constraint-satisfying regime.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4847,"While our approach can similarly be applied to upper bounds on penalties, there’s unfortunately no guarantee that the constraints will be satisfied at every moment during training, but only at convergence.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4848,As such it is not clear how these methods would apply to our specific experimental setups.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4849,"Q1: In Theorem 4.3, the result holds for any $k$ and $M$. The authors claim that if we take a limit of $M \to \infty$ with fixed $k$, the practical dynamics converges to the discrete-time mean-field limit, in Section 4.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4850,"However, to state the result of Theorem 4.3, $k$ should be bigger than $M c_\eta$ from the dentition of $\tilde{\rho}_k^M$, as shown under the equation (4).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
4851,How do we take a limit of $M \to\infty$ ? Does k also go $\infty$?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4852,A1: Thanks for pointing this out.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
4853,The result of this theorem holds uniformly for any $k$ (not a fixed $k$).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4854,"Besides, we do not require $k$ bigger than $M c_\eta$ in the definition of $\tilde{\rho}_k^M$. When $k$ is no more than $M c_\eta$, $\tilde{\rho}_k^M$ and $\rho_k^M$ are stochastic processes with same distribution and thus the Wasserstein distance between them is 0.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4855,"And for any $k$ is greater than $M c_\eta$, we have the uniform bound (w.r.t. $k$) as stated in the theorem 4.3.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4856,We are sorry for not stating this clearly in the theorem and we have revisited the present of the theorem. We will fix this issue in the next revision.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
4857,"We also point out that, as our system is complicated, in taking the limit of $M\to\infty$, we need to ensure that the number of iteration we run is larger than $Mc_\eta$. To be specific, the asymptotic convergence would be",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4859,"where the joint limit of k and M requires that $k\eta\to\infty$; $\exp(C\alpha^{2}k\eta)\eta^{2}=o(1)$; $(k\eta)/(Mc)=q(1+o(1))$ with $q>1$. Here if $q \leq 1$, we degenerate to Langevin. But when $q>1$ (intuitively that means, when $M$ is large, the number of iterations we run is larger), our dynamics is different from Langevin, which is what we do in the practice.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4860,"Also, we would like to remark that this seemingly strange things is in fact the ‘artifact’ caused by the using of Langevin dynamics at beginning to obtain the $M$ initial samples when we designed the practical implementation of the proposed methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4861,"However, it is not really necessary to use Langevin dynamics to get $M$ initial samples, as we can simply using some other initialization distribution and get the $M$ initial samples from that distribution (and by this setting, our dynamics is simply the second phases in Eq (3)).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

4883,"Due to nonlinearities in typical deep models, it is at least not obvious how to calculate the mutual information between data and parameters.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4884,The main challenge here would certainly be to come up with an effective estimator.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4885,"Relatedly, one would have to design priors and architecture to achieve a specific mutual information.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4886,"> The connection between mutual information and generalization has been studied in several contexts [see, e.g., the references in this paper [...]] and further exploration is desirable.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4887,This paper is giving an information-theoretic perspective on existing variational inference methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4888,"Such a perspective is interesting, but needs to be further developed and explained.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4889,"Specifically, how can mutual information in this context be formally linked to generalization/overfitting?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4890,We updated section 2.2 to relate to the references you mentioned.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
4891,They explore the link of limiting mutual information and generalization error mostly in theory (and in particular for adaptive analysis).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4892,"In contrast, we deploy this principle in a practical model structure that is easily applicable to many existing deep and variational learning approaches and provide empirical evidence of the validity of our framework.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4893,>,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4894,"Also, the definition of mutual information used in this paper uses the inferred distribution q (e.g., in eq. 2), which is somewhat unusual.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
4895,"As a result, constraining the model will alter the mutual information and I think the effect of this should be remarked on.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

4900,Thank you to Reviewer 1 for noting the clarity of our presentation and reproducibility.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4901,We also appreciate the constructive criticism and thought that went into your review.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
4902,We spent a considerable amount of time trying to fulfill the reviewer’s request to match state of the art (SOTA) on PTB.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4903,"To get SOTA on PTB, we need massive architectures, which considerable computing power and experimentation at the extreme limit of what is achievable for our team.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
4904,"Still, we pursued two directions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4905,"First, we tried to reimplement an architecture similar to  Melis et al. 2017.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4906,"However, they did not publish their code, hyperparameters, or weights, requiring re-implementing and re-training from scratch.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4907,"We tried this path, but soon realized we would not be done in time (especially with a hyperparameter search).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4908,"We then tried to weave neuromodulation and differentiable plasticity into the architecture and code base of Merity et al., ICLR 2018 (also tied for SOTA).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4909,"However, while they could simply leverage existing PyTorch implementations of LSTMs (written in extremely fast C++), we had to re-implement LSTMs “by hand” (i.e. as a series of connected layers) in PyTorch to introduce plasticity and neuromodulation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4910,"As a result, our networks thus ran considerably slower, by more than 10x (not because our method is intrinsically slower, but just for lack of engineering optimizations on our bespoke Python implementations; we confirmed this by observing that a similar “hand-built” reimplementation of simple, non-plastic LSTMs ran similarly slower, while producing results identical to Merity et al.).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4911,These experiments are thus unfortunately still running.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4912,"For these reasons (and more provided below), we thus think it more fair (and necessary) to make such experiments the subject of a future paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
4913,"That said, we still believe the results in the current paper demonstrate the benefits of our techniques on a sizable model, and thus it would benefit the community to allow people to know about, and build upon, these new methods and results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,12,12
4914,"The purpose of the present paper is to introduce a novel technique and show that it can produce an advantage in realistic settings, which we believe our PTB task confirms.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4915,"Our claim is that, all other things being equal (especially the number of parameters), a neuromodulated plastic LSTM outperformed a standard LSTM on this particular benchmark task.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4916,We do **not** want to claim that our results are anywhere near SOTA.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4917,We have modified our text to avoid possible misunderstandings (see end of next-to-last paragraph in Section 4).,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
4918,"Additionally, philosophically, If SOTA results are the bar for all papers to be accepted into conferences like ICLR, then those venues will be the exclusive domain of those with either the computation or time (i.e. large-scale resources) to dedicate to such results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4919,"In that case, many cutting edge ideas will by necessity be excluded from the discussion, as will many research groups.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4920,"Moreover, insisting on papers to be SOTA to be accepted also likely encourages p-hacking and shoddy science to game the results (even if unintentionally), reducing the quality of science our community tries to build on.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
4921,"Re: ""Parameters of the model"": All trainable parameters of the Hebbian synapses (alpha and w in Equation 1, plus the neuromodulation parameters) are included in this parameter count.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4922,"To equalize the number of parameters across architectures, we reduce the number of hidden units in the plastic models in comparison to the non-plastic baseline.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4923,We have clarified this in the text.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
4924,"Re: ""Attention"": Non-trainable, homogenous plasticity can indeed be compared to a form of attention, i.e. “attending to the recent past” in the words of Ba et al. 2016.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
4925,"However, differentiable plasticity allows for the plasticity of each connection to be trained; as a result, different connections play different roles and it is not at all clear that the analogy with attention remains relevant (see e.g. the clever mechanisms automatically implemented by the trained plasticity connections in the image completion experiment of the Differentiable Plasticity paper, Miconi et al. 2018, sections 4.3 and S.3, which can hardly be described as simply “attention”)",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,15,13

5097,Thank you for your review of our work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
5098,The following are your concerns of our work:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

5102,d. Details of the calibration procedure,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5103,We address them as follows (in two parts):,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5104,a. Prior distributions of hyperparameters:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5105,"We envisage an optimizer not merely as update equations, but as the conjunction of the update equations, the hyperparameters, and distributions of those hyperparameters.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5106,Those distributions should be prescribed by the designers of the optimizer.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5107,"This is crucial: For example, if we take Adam with LR between $10^1$ and $10^5$ and claim that Adam is less tunable than others, the evaluation is inherently faulty, as it doesn't capture where the mode of the distribution of LRs for which Adam is expected to work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5108,These prescriptions are absent for the optimizers considered in the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5109,"Therefore, we define them from either mathematical reasoning (say learning rate is non-negative, $\beta_1, \beta_2$ in Adam are between (0, 1) and close to 1) or using the calibration step, where we determine those distributions by fitting on the configurations that yielded reasonably good results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5110,"We choose simple priors for their ease of estimation, though given enough computation, arbitrarily complex priors can be computed and used.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5111,We fail to see the explicit relationship between our work and the papers you have referenced.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5112,Specifically [1] only proposes that there is an optimal batch size that is dependent on the momentum parameter.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5113,"We do not consider tuning the batch size, as we do not consider it a hyperparameter of the optimizer itself.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
5114,"[2] shows that instead of using LR decay schedule, increasing batch size has a similar effects on training, but results in faster training.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
5115,"[3] talks about the existence of an effective learning rate as a function of learning rate and the norm of the weights, and proposes that the optimal learning rate is inversely proportional to the weight decay parameter.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5116,"This doesn’t, however, trivially lend itself to modeling priors.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
5117,"In summary, these papers show a complex interplay between the parameters giving rise to other notions, but not provide any methods to jointly model these hyperparameters.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
5118,"In the absence of such knowledge, we use our calibration procedure.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5119,The distributions we use are justified in section 3.2 in the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5120,"However, we accept the fact that a more complex distribution that might model the interaction between these hyperparameters might exist, and using that to sample for an HPO would be better.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
5121,b. Loss landscape plots and relation to tunability:,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
5122,"We show in figures 1.a, 1.b, as you rightly pointed out, the landscapes of loss function of the HPO objective as a function of the hypothetical hyperparameter $\theta$. There seems to be a misunderstanding of the purpose of figures 1.a, and 1.b.: These figures do not show what we try to measure, but they merely illustrate by example what properties we would like a tunability metric to have.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5123,We describe this in the beginning of Section 2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5124,"In Section 5, we explain why existing measures of tunability are unable to make the distinction between the cases in Figure 1a.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5125,"We would like to emphasize that the point of Figures 1a, 1b is to illustrate the necessary properties that a proposed metric for tunability - it is not our intention to create such plots for our actual experiments.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5126,"If you are interested in these nonetheless, a very recent publication by Asi & Duchi (2019) shows the plot of lr vs performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5156,- While it might be beneficial to fine-tune the modules for a specific parent task we want each module to be an expert for their own task as it facilitates a plug-and-play architecture.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5157,Fine-tuning may push the modules towards blindly improving parent module’s performance but (i) badly affect interpretability of inputs and outputs; and (ii) may also reduce the lower module’s performance on its own task.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5173,In the updated manuscript we state both these facts explicitly and state much earlier that ‘i’ is the index for entities.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5174,2. The paper says v_i (initial representation of each entity) is obtained by looking at the contextualized representations (LSTM outputs) of entity mention in the context.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

5185,5. What does it mean that in training time the model “updates” the location node representation with the encoding of the correct span. Do you mean you use the encoding instead?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

5202,Q2: Technical description and justification,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5203,"In the paper, we make the observation that codeword based approaches are equivalent to learning the biases of a fixed network, whereas the fast-weights-based HOF approach learns all of the weights.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5204,"Therefore, we conclude that HOF is mathematically at least as general as codeword based architectures.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5205,"We further show, with experiments, that the coding provided by HOF is more efficient than codeword-based approaches in terms of number of parameters in the decoder.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5206,There is similar evidence in the literature which suggests that fast-weights based approaches can be more efficient than static networks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5207,"However at this point, similar to our paper, the evidence is empirical and a theoretical justification of this phenomenon is missing.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5209,Q3: Architecture of encoder/mapping network,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5210,"In addition to experiments on a new dataset, we have performed new evaluations of variants of HOF on our original dataset to demonstrate that HOF performs competitively even when we change the encoder architecture, decoder depth, decoder activation function, or input sampling for the decoder network.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5211,"For example, using Resnet18 as the encoder network gives almost identical performance in terms of average chamfer distance on our original test set.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5212,The complete quantitative results of these comparisons will be included in an updated PDF before the end of the discussion period.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
5213,Q4: Number of mapping layers,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5214,Our original results reported in Table 1 compare two different mapping function architectures.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5217,"In response to your comments, we have also conducted an additional experiment with a mapping network with 6 hidden layers with 128 units each; the test performance of this architecture is almost identical to that of HOF-3 (1.2485 average Chamfer distance with 6 layers compared with 1.247 average CD for 3 layers).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5218,Q5: Vanishing/exploding gradients,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5219,"In all of our experiments, we address the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients by dividing by the square root of the in-degree of each neuron (as in [2]).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5221,"Another advantage of HOF over deeper, fixed decoder architectures is that it admits extremely shallow decoders, which require less careful tuning of hyperparameters such as initialization scaling and normalization compared with deeper networks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5222,"For this work, our goal was not necessarily to find the optimal architecture for the decoder, but rather to demonstrate that the usage of the higher-order function paradigm allows for a much smaller decoder architecture than LVC methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5285,"Instead of trying to come up with a custom learning rate schedule, which would require deciding how frequently to decay the learning rate, and by what factor it should be decayed, all one needs to do is perform a grid search over a fixed set of lambdas to find an automated schedule that is competitive with hand-designed schedules (which are the result of years of accumulated experience in the field).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5287,Summary of our response,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5288,-------------------------------------,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5289,We are certain that the data processing inequality is used correctly.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,3,16
5290,"As you stated, the DPI implies for any Markov chain X -> Y -> Z that I(X,Y) >= I(X,Z).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5291,"Unlike suggested in the review, our model is defined in the form \theta -> \tilde{\theta} -> D, as shown in Figure 1a.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5292,"Following your feedback, we updated section 2.1 and 2.3 for more clarity.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
5293,Detailed response,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5294,-------------------------------------,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5295,We interleave parts of the review with our detailed response for ease of reading.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5296,> [...],reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5297,the major problem of this paper is that it uses the data processing inequality (DPI) in a **wrong** way.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5298,"As in (Cover and Thomas, 2012), which is also cited in this paper, DPI is defined on a Markov chain X -> Y -> Z and we have I(X,Y) >= I(X,Z).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
5299,"However, based on the definition of \theta and \tilde{\theta} given in the first sentence of section 2.3, the relation between \theta, \tilde{\theta} and D should be: D <- \theta -> \tilde{\theta} (if it is a generative model) or D -> \theta -> \tilde{\theta} (if a discriminative model).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5300,"Response: We are interested in limiting the mutual information I(\theta, D) between our learned parameters \theta and the dataset D.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5301,"However, this is hard to calculate for typical deep models.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5302,"Therefore we introduce a model that forms a Markov chain \theta -> \tilde{\theta} -> D, as shown in Figure 1a.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5303,"Hereby, \tilde{\theta} is a noisy version of the parameters \theta.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5304,"Crucially, the data D is defined to be dependent only on the noise-corrupted version \tilde{\theta}. By choosing a convenient noise process and prior for \theta we can easily control I(\tilde{\theta}, \theta).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5305,"This gives us an upper bound on the mutual information I(D, \theta) between data and parameters, according to the DPI.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5306,We updated section 2.3 to reflect this more clearly.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
5307,"> I had trouble to understand some parts of this paper, since some of the sentences do not make sense to me.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5308,For example,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5309,- the sentence under eq. (2),reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5310,"- the sentence ""Because the identity of the datapoint can never be learned by ..."" What is the identity of a data point?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5311,It looks like section 2.1 wants to show the connections between eq. (2) and other popularly used inference methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5312,"Somehow, those connections are not clear to me.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5313,Response: The aim of section 2.1 is to motivate limiting mutual information for the purpose of generalization.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5314,We link generalization problems reported in the literature to the introduced information measure.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5315,"The information necessary to identify or distinguish between training samples is quantified by the empirical entropy, and we called it the identity of the samples.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
5316,We updated the section to address all of your feedback.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
5317,Thank you for your comments. Please find below our response to your questions and concerns.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
5318,1) Technical contributions,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5319,We are glad that the reviewer agrees that we are tackling a long standing and important problem and acknowledge the fact that neither the definition of constrained MDPs nor the application of Lagrangian relaxation to solve these problems is novel by itself.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
5320,We should have stated our exact technical contributions more clearly and have adapted the paper to do so.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
5321,For completeness we will list these below:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5322,"a) We introduce pointwise, per-state constraints to learn more consistent behavior compared a single global constraint, and regress the resulting state-dependent Lagrangian multipliers using a neural network to exploit generalization across similar states.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5323,"b) Instead of recombining the reward and cost directly on the environment side and learning a single value estimate, we train a critic network to output both return and penalty value estimates as well as the Lagrangian multipliers themselves, effectively providing more structure to the critic.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5324,We only combine the different terms appropriately for the actor update.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5325,"c) We show that we can train a single, bound-conditional policy that can optimize penalty across a range of bounds and can be used to dynamically trade off reward and penalty.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5326,2) Comparison with the original benchmark reward,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5327,We have extended the results on Cartpole to include the original reward as defined in the DM Control Suite (incl. bonus for low control).,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
5328,"We found that compared to the original setting, our method is able to reduce the average control norm by over 50% across the entire episode, and by over 80% after the swingup phase, without significant reduction in the average return as measured without control bonus.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5329,3) Claims about bang-bang control in continuous RL,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5330,The reviewer is right in that the claim of RL often leading to bang-bang control is too strongly worded.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
5331,This is only the case when the objective function is not well-designed and one is naively optimizing for success only.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5332,"Designing a proper objective function is however often not trivial and more of an art, requiring several iterations to achieve the desired behavior.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5333,This work tries to remove some of the complexities in designing such a function.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5334,4) State-dependent lower bound,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5335,"Defining a state-dependent bound is indeed not trivial and requires knowledge of what is feasible in the system, and as such we leave this up to future work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,7,7
5336,In this paper we have made the approximation that the state distribution is stationary and the discount is large enough to assume that the value is more or less constant.,reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,1,7
5337,"While this holds for locomotion tasks, this does not apply in e.g. the swingup phase of the cartpole task and as a result the penalty is completely ignored during this phase.",reb_fine,rebuttal_future,7.0,1,7
5338,Thank you for your comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
5339,"We have performed additional experiments in order to address them, particularly training and evaluating HOF as in [1].",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,5,16
5340,Q1: Evaluation as in [1],reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5341,"In accordance with these recommendations in [1], we have trained HOF on the dataset provided by the authors of [1] and evaluated it according to the F1 metric that is proposed.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
5342,"We find that HOF provides competitive performance to existing methods, giving the highest average F1 score of all methods in [1].",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5343,We will report quantitative results on this benchmark in a revised PDF submitted before the end of the discussion period.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
5344,Q2: Input shape,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5345,We have performed new comparison experiments to address this question.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
5346,Varying the input shape does affect performance; sampling the surface of the 3d sphere gives worse performance than sampling the interior of the sphere (1.369 average chamfer distance for surface of sphere versus 1.247 for interior).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5347,"In addition, we find that sampling the interior of the 4D sphere, rather than the 3D sphere gives a fairly significant improvement in performance (1.195 average chamfer distance for 4D sphere vs 1.247 for 3D).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5348,"Since we are learning an arbitrary mapping (rather than, for example, a projection to a manifold), the mapping domain does not explicitly induce any topological constraints such as genus.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5349,"If our mapping didn't have to be continuous, it wouldn't matter what shape we sampled.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5350,"However, because we use neural networks with continuous activation functions (relus) to represent the mapping, it must be continuous.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5351,"And because the experiments above indicate that the mapping domain affects the quality of the reconstructions, it is possible that the sampling domain imposes topological constraints on the set of objects.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5352,"It's difficult to say what the ""best"" shape to sample from is; however, in future work, we would like to investigate strategies for learning the best input shape to sample from.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,7,1
5353,Q3: Sampling the input shape,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5354,"Our input 3D points are sampled from the interior of the unit sphere, rather than the surface (we have clarified this in the revised manuscript).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
5355,Samples are drawn uniformly at random from within the sphere in order to avoid overfitting to a particular gridding structure.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

5459,"In contrast to PlaNet, the difference is that this work learns an actor-critic model in place of online planning with the cross entropy method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
5460,"However, I found the contribution of the actor-critic model is insufficient and requires additional experimental validation (see below).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
5461,Dreamer is a novel algorithm that belongs to the family of actor critic methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

5550,It was designed to increase the model expressiveness.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

5552,"And since it is slower than the standard softmax by definition, we chose not to compare with it in the paper.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
5553,Our algorithm addresses speed up in softmax inference.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
5554,This is fundamentally different from Sparse-gated MoE. We divide the output space into multiple overlapped subsets.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

5585,$$\displaystyle\sum_{\mathrm{z}}\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)}\ \mathrm{log}\ \frac{\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)}}{\hat{p}\mathrm{(c|z)}} = \displaystyle\sum_{\mathrm{z}}\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)}\bigg(\mathrm{log}\ \frac{\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)}}{\hat{p}\mathrm{(z|c)}} + \mathrm{log}\ \frac{\hat{p}\mathrm{(z)}}{\hat{p}\mathrm{(c)}} \bigg)$$,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,16,16
5586,"Because the $\hat{p}\mathrm{(c)}$ is constant, and $\hat{p}\mathrm{(z)}$ is not included in our optimization, we just optimize $\displaystyle\sum_{\mathrm{z}}\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)}\mathrm{log}[\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)} / \hat{p}\mathrm{(z|c)}]$. Since the $\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)}$ and $\hat{p}\mathrm{(z|c)}$ are both normalized distributions, the $D_{KL}[\hat{q}\mathrm{(z|c)} || \hat{p}\mathrm{(z|c)}]$ is always positive.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

5624,"While existing works on cascade models learn parameters by inferring the direct infector of every infected node (i.e., estimating $P(I_i|D_{\leq i})$), we need to infer the whole past trajectory to compute node states (i.e., considering $P(I_i|D,I_{<i})$), which is greatly more difficult but the proposed learning approach allowed us to efficiently deal with it.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
