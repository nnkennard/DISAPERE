50,"GMM is also much faster in inference compared to Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) (Rosenblatt, 1956).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

114,1. vs StackGAN: Our method introduces a learning method that allows for training generative models with disentangled latents without compromising on the generative quality (unlike all SOTA mutual information (MI) based disentangled representation learning methods such as beta-VAE or info-GAN).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
115,"More fundamentally, our method provably avoids issues posed by d-separation that theoretically prohibit disentanglement in the current SOTA methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
116,This is completely different from the motivation of StackGAN which aims to use iterative refinement (like several other generative models) to learn a generative map from image captions and does not care about disentanglement.,reb_fine,rebuttal_mitigate-criticism,8.0,1,8
117,2. Unsupervised control variable discovery: Beta VAE (or other MI-based methods) disentangle the latents by compromising the generative quality.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
118,"The more the model forces disentanglement, by giving more weight to a certain information-theoretic regularizer, the worse the generated images become.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
119,"By decoupling the training into two steps, our method allows for far better disentanglement than beta-VAE like methods without compromising the generative quality.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
120,Novelty: Our method aims to solve the fundamental issue of d-separation in disentangled representation learning.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
121,It allows for a theoretically consistent way of obtaining factorisation in the posterior without any information-theoretic penalties.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
122,"It is true, that one can describe the method as a (non-trivial) combination of beta-vae + GAN.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3

129,A: General architecture: The whole framework includes a translator and a discriminator.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
130,(1) Translator.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
131,"Translator consists of an encoder, a decoder, and a skip network, which first learn the representation of the graph and then decode it back to the target graph.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
132,See details in the third part of the answer.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
133,(2) Discriminator.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
134,Our discriminator aims to classify the generated graphs and the real target graphs given the input graph.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
135,"(3) The translator and discriminator are trained together, and the final goal is that the discriminator cannot distinguish the generated graphs and real target graphs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
136,"After training such a model, the translator will be used in the test phase.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,7,1
137,The logic behind edge-to-edge convolution:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
138,"(1) Generally speaking, the purpose of edge-to-edge convolution layers is to aggregate the neighborhood information of nodes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
139,"Specifically, the n-th edge-to-edge convolution layer aggregates the n-th hop connection information of nodes related to each edge.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
140,"(2) Different from image convolution, for each hidden channel, we have two filters, one is a column vector while the other is a row vector.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
141,"To learn the nth hop information of edge <i,j>, row filter aggregates all the (n-1)-th hop information of outgoing edges of node i and column filter aggregates all the (n-1)-th hop information of incoming edges of node j.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
142,"(3)  Edge-to-edge layers are important to extract some higher-level graph features, e.g., the n-hop reachability from a node to another; n-hop in-degree and out-degree, and many other higher-order patterns.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
143,Different blocks in the graph translator:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
144,"Translator consists of an encoder, a decoder, and a skip network.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
145,(1) Encoder.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
146,The encoder does n-hop edge information aggregation from the input graphs using edge-to-edge layers and then uses the edge-to-node layer to learn the latent representation of nodes.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
147,(2) Decoder.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
148,"Reversely, the graph decoder first uses node-to-edge layers to decode the node representations to aggregated edge information and then further decode that into adjacency matrix, which is the final generated graphs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
149,(3) Skip-network.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
150,"Over the encoder-decoder framework, we also added skip-network (the black line of Fig.1) which can directly map the edge aggregation information in every hop from the input graph to the output graph so that can preserve the local information in every resolution (i.e., every hop).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
151,----------------------------------------------------------------------------,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
152,Q: how exactly do you do a L1 loss on graphs? I'd have to assume the topology of the graph is unchanged between Gy and T(Gx) ~ and then maybe take L1 of weight matrix? But then is this general enough ~ given your stated goal of modeling different topologies?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
153,"Either ways, more explanation / and perhaps equations to clarify this loss would be very helpful.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
154,A: (1) L1 norm is applied to the weight matrix.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
155,"Our methodology is still general enough which is achieved by a trade-off between L1 loss and adversarial loss (GAN-D), which jointly enforces Gy and T(Gx) to follow a similar topological pattern but may not necessarily the same.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
156,"Specifically, L1 makes T(Gx) share the same rough outline of sparsity pattern like Gy, while under this outline, adversarial loss allows the T(Gx) to vary to some degree.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
157,(2) Combining L1 loss and adversarial loss is well-recognized and validated.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
158,"Works on image-translation have proposed and utilized L1 loss and adversarial loss jointly in GAN, for example, reference [1] (with 600+ citations) and reference [2] (with 1300+ citations).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

165,"Q: Third, and slightly related to the previous point, why do you need a conditional GAN discriminator, if you already model similarity by L1?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
166,"Typically one would use a GAN-D() to model ""proximity"" to the source-distribution, and then a similarity loss (L1 in your case) to model ""proximity"" to the actual input sample, in the case of traditional domains.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
167,"Instead, here you seem to suggest using L1 and GAN to do basically the same thing, or with significant overlap anyways.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

169,Please explain the logic for this architectural choice.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
170,A:(1) The logic of using both of them has been explained in the answer to the last question.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
171,(2) The logic has been well-utilized and verified in the image-translation domain. Again please see the details in the answer to the last question.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
172,(3),reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
173,Our ablation experiment also demonstrates the similar advantage of using both losses for graph translation than only using L1 loss.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
174,"Specifically, the proposed GT-GAN that uses both loses outperformed the S-Generator that only uses L1 loss on all three datasets by 10% in accuracy on average as shown in Table 2,3 and 4.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

176,"Q: Four, could you please explain the setting for the “gold standard” experiment.

179,"One way to evaluate this is by “indirect evaluation”, where we use the graphs generated by different comparison methods as training data to train a classifier based on KCNN (see reference (Nikolentzos, et al.,2017) in the paper), and then compare which model generates “more-real graphs” by testing their corresponding trained classifier on test set which consists of real graphs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

222,POINTS 1 AND 2 OF THE REVIEW,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
223,"The reviewer has noticed that the cw-distance resembles that of a U-statistic MMD estimate, and thus the proposed model very much resembles MMD itself.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
224,"We fully agree with the reviewer, that CWAE is a model based on the kernel as the divergence measure for distributions, and consequently can be seen as a modified variant of WAE-MMD (we have added the respective comments in the paper, see the extended introduction, and added a section B in the appendix, which discusses the comparison in more details).",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,3,5
225,"However, there are some important, in our opinion, differences between those two models, which also result in an improved training speed and stability of CWAE compared to WAE-MMD (see refined experiments in section 5, as well as figures in the appendix showing comparisons between proposed CWAE and WAE and SWAE models in the Appendix).",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,3,15

336,We thank the reviewer for the positive and constructive feedback.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
337,Below we answer the questions and concerns:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
338,Question 1:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
339,We agree with the referee and will therefore include a visualization of the trained distributions using Gumbel top-k sampling and a realization of the sampling pattern.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,2,5
340,We are currently running experiments to obtain Gumbel top-k results for the ‘lines and circles’ and CIFAR10 experiments as well.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,2,3
341,"Since we did not sufficiently emphasize that leveraging Gumbel top-k sampling for learning signal subsampling matrices is part of the novelty of the present work, we clarified this in the revised manuscript.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
342,"In fact, using Gumbel top-k sampling in this context can be seen as a constrained version of DPS, with shared weights across the M distributions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
343,"To also include previously-published baselines, we are currently running experiments with the recently proposed LOUPE method by Bahadir et al. (2019).",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
344,Question 2:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
345,"Indeed, the notion of compressed sensing has spurred vast work, ranging from sensing strategies to signal recovery algorithms.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
346,"On the sensing side, sampling strategies are typically designed to satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP); describing isometry of the sensing matrix given K-sparse vectors, and thereby providing signal recovery guarantees, given an appropriate algorithm.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
347,"On the algorithm side, sparsity in some basis transform is typically exploited, leveraging a wide variety of optimization algorithms spanning from proximal gradient methods to projection-over-convex-set and greedy algorithms.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
348,"More recently, deep learning methods have been proposed for fast signal recovery from CS measurements, yielding state-of-the-art results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
349,"In this context, DPS adopts current practices in data-driven CS recovery, but extends this to incorporate subsampling (the sensing) in an end-to-end pipeline.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
350,Such an end-to-end (sampling-to-any-task) learning strategy opens up opportunities for data-driven optimization of sensing strategies beyond theoretically-established results.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
351,"As pointed out by the referee, the shortcomings of disjoint optimization in classical CS are perhaps most evident when high-level tasks such as classification are part of the pipeline.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
352,"As such, we are currently running additional experiments to better illustrate this.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
353,Question 3:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
354,We agree with the reviewer that such a comparison might be of interest.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
355,"As such, we are currently running additional experiments to include a comparison to Gumbel top-k (as we did for the MNIST classification case) as well as the method proposed by Bahadir et al. (2019).",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
356,"Notably, and unlike our method, the latter approach does not permit setting a specific subsampling rate, with this rate is only being indirectly controlled via hyperparameter settings.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
357,"As a follow-up on our answer regarding the second question, we would like to mention that we added a case in the MNIST classification experiment (DPS-topk), in which we jointly train a reconstruction network with a subsampling pattern.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
358,We subsequently train the classifier network on the reconstructed images.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
359,It shows that learning a task-adaptive (classification in this case) sampling pattern outperforms disjoint learning of sampling and the task.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
360,Thank you for your comments! We appreciate the very detailed review.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14

362,"Similar to your hypothesis, we suspect that multilingual BERT cannot produce high-quality representations for Turkish and Finnish.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
363,This can lead to worse performance of BERTScore.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
364,"Based on [1] and [2], YiSi-1 trains word2vec embeddings on the monolingual data provided as part of the WMT translation task, which may explain its comparably higher performance on these languages.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
365,"We believe it is an important future direction to improve the performance of multilingual BERT on low-resource language, but this requires a broader study of training BERT in low-resource regimes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,7,1
366,We have studied computing the idf on a larger corpus.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
367,"We computed idf scores using the monolingual English corpus released by WMT18, a much larger amount of data then we used before.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
368,The importance-weighted version of BERTScore using these idf scores performs worse than the original importance-weighted version.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
369,We hypothesize this is due to the domain shift between the corpora.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
370,"Beyond paraphrase detection, we didn’t try using BERTScore for text similarity tasks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
371,The results on paraphrase are definitely promising.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1

380,"Q1: The paper is easy to follow but the authors are expected to clarify the rationality in integration of the loss function. How the parameter of \lambda_r, \lambda_t, and \lambda_r influence the performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
381,It would be better if the authors could present some analysis.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
382,"A1: There are in general two rules to follow when choosing the lambda for optimization: 1) the loss term provides gradient in similar numerical range, such that no single loss should dominate the training since accuracies in depth and camera pose are both important to reach a good consensus.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
383,2) we found in practice the camera rotation has higher impact on the accuracy of the depth probably but not the opposite.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
384,This is presumably because that pose cost volume accumulate depth differences of all the pixels such that is more tolerant to the depth error.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
385,"To encourage better performance of pose, we set a relatively large \lambda_r.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
386,Note that all the losses are necessary to achieve good performance.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
387,"On the validation data, some preliminary experiments by grid search values of each lambda, show that the performance of our model is not very sensitive to various values of lambda.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
388,"Therefore we provide a combination of lambda that produces the model for our experiment, and presumably there could be other settings that may potentially further improve the performance.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

390,"Q2: The authors are expected to make more comprehensive analysis with the state-of-the-art methods, and also analyze why some alternative methods outperforms the proposed methods in table I and table II.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
391,A2: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
392,"We add more analysis with the state of the art in Section 4.2, especially about the case that other methods outperforms our method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
393,Q3:The experiments in section 4.3 are also expected to be improved.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,2,15
394,It is difficult to draw a conclusion that the method is better than other ones based on such limited experiments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
395,A3: Thanks for this point.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
396,"However, the main experiments and the conclusions are in Sec. 4.2; and  thus Section 4.2 included  much more insights and discussion of our model Vs. the other baselines in the revised version.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
397,"In contrast,  Section 4.3 lists the ablation study, where the purpose of experiments is to verify the necessity and sufficiency of some system design options of our model and demonstrate the behavior under controlled experiments, instead of comparing with other methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
398,"Specifically, we show the performance of our method with different number of iterations, with and without pose cost volume, and different numbers of the input view.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
399,"At the same time, we found that our method also outperforms other methods in some aspects.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
400,"In Figure 2, the curves are going down, which means that our method can effectively reduce depth and pose error from DeMon.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
401,"The solid curves are consistently lower than dashed curves, which means our pose cost volume outperforms Steinbrücker et al. (2011) in pose estimation and further benefits depth estimation.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
402,"In Figure 3, the blue curve is significant lower than orange curve, which means that our method is more robust in the situation with fewer views than COLMAP.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
403,"Even though, the main purpose is not to compare to others but provide some analysis on important model components.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
404,The reviewer observed that “authors need to highlight at least one practical advance introduced by the CW distance” and suggested the following potential options:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
405,1) Faster training times.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
406,2) Stabler training.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
407,3) Usefulness of the CW distance outside of the autoencoder context.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
408,"Ad. 1) (faster training) The experiments show, that CWAE model approaches best generalization, measured with the FID score, much more rapidly, than it is the case with WAE or SWAE models.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
409,"E.g., when trained on the CelebA problem, the FID-score in case of CWAE drops below 100 after only about 75 batches, while for the WAE model only near 400 batches, it does so.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
410,The same applies to SWAE.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
411,"Needless to say, the FID score for CWAE is near a common best value (after about 500 epochs) of about 95 (these are results are for a DeConv encoder-decoder architecture, see. Appendix E for details; for a direct comparison with Tolstikhin at al’s paper results for an identical architecture to theirs are given in Table 1 in the paper) after a much shorter processing time.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
412,"This is both thanks to the quicker convergence, but also due to faster batch processing (as it was shown in the paper).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
413,The MMD-like cloud-to-cloud formula for CW-distance (see equation (3) in the paper) is much more cumbersome than the actual one cloud-to-distribution used in the experiments derived in the paper and shown in equation at page 5 of the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
414,The proposed Cramer-Wold kernel behaves correctly.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
415,"We have added graphs describing this to the paper, exchanging those on page 8 (as the new are much more clearer).",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
416,"Graphs comparing CWAE, WAE and SWAE learning, on both CelebA and CIFAR10 datasets, shall be added to the Appendix.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
417,"Ad. 2) (stable training) We have run repeated experiments with different initializations for all the generative models, as the reviewer has suggested.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
418,"All experiments show that CWAE learning process is stable and repetitive: the standard deviations, for most of the coefficients computed during training are smaller than those of WAE or SWAE models (in particular CWAE minimizes WAE distance faster then WAE-MMD).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
419,We have added appropriate graphs to the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
420,"Ad. 3) (CW usefulness) We have verified how the Cramer-Wold metric works as a Gaussian goodness of fit,",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
421,"however, the results were not satisfactory.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,15,16
422,"The tests based on Cramer-Wold metric were, in general, in the middle of compared tests (Mardia, Henze-Zirkler and Royston tests).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
423,We doubt it can be efficiently applied in this direction.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
424,"However, since Cramer-Wold metric is defined by characteristic kernel, it can be applied in the large field of kernel-based methods in machine learning (where its particular advantage lies in the fact that it can be efficiently computed for the mixture of radial Gaussians).",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
425,"The reviewer noted that “besides having closed form in the case of a Gaussian prior (which other statistical distances could potentially also achieve), it would be nice to see some discussion of why the authors believe their CW-distance is conceptually superior to such alternatives.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
426,"In our opinion sliced approach works well for neural networks, as the neural networks see/process data by applying similar one dimensional projections.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
427,"Also the success of neural networks based on the classical activation functions, as compared to RBF networks, supports this.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
428,"Concerning the closed-form, Cramer-Wold kernel is the only known to the authors, which is given by the sliced approach and has a closed form for radial gaussians.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
429,"The reviewer also noted, that “Silverman's rule of thumb is only asymptotically optimal when the underlying data-generating distribution itself is Gaussian. Perhaps you can argue here that due to CLT: the projected data (for high-dimensional latent spaces) should look approximately Gaussian?”.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
430,"In our opinion the model works well due to the fact that we compare it to the Gaussian N(0,I), where the Silverman’s kernel is optimal.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
431,"However, if the prior in general would not be standard Gaussian, the situation could possibly be different.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
432,We are grateful for your feedback.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
433,We hope that the above discussion assuaged the reviewer’s concerns regarding novelty and some unclear details.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,14,1
434,We briefly address the two questions regarding the setup:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
435,"During testing, in the setting with known GT boxes (Sec 4.2), we assume that the 2D instance boxes are given.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
436,"In the detection setting, the 2D instance boxes are the result of the learned detector.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
437,"Given the (detected or known) instance boxes, the union boxes and binary masks can be easily computed - the union box is just the larger box containing both instance boxes, and the mask highlights these instance boxes in the union box.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

442,"Yes, we experiment only with myopic variants of exploration, but (A) our approach is not limited to this initial set of behaviour modulations, and could be extended to trade off between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, or between model-free and model-based mechanisms; and (B) the variations we consider may not be ideal, but they are the ones most commonly used in domains like Atari.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

448,"Thank you for this suggestion, we have now clarified this connection in Section 3.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
449,We acknowledge that f departs from LP in a number of ways.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
450,"First, it does not contain learner-subjective information, but this is partly mitigated through the joint use of with prioritised replay that over-samples high error experience.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
451,"Another potential mechanism by which the episodic return can be indicative of future learning is because an improved policy tends to be preceded by some higher-return episodes -- in general, there is a lag between best-seen performance and reliably reproducing it.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
452,"Second, the fitness is based on absolute returns not differences in returns as suggested by Equation 1; this makes no difference to the relative orderings of z (and the resulting probabilities induced by the bandit), but it has the benefit that the non-stationarity takes a different form: a difference-based metric will appear stationary if the policy performance keeps increasing at a steady rate, but such a policy must be changing significantly to achieve that progress, and therefore the selection mechanism should keep revisiting other modulations.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
453,"In contrast, our absolute fitness naturally has this effect when paired with a non-stationary bandit.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

508,Q：I did not completely follow the arguments towards directed graph deconvolution operators.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
509,There is lack of clarity and the explanation seems lacking in parts in this particular section; especially since this is the key contribution of this work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
510,A: (1) Our decoder is symmetric to the encoder in their architectures.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
511,The encoder does n-hop edge information aggregation from the input graphs and learns the latent representation of nodes.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
512,"Then, we first decode the node embedding to get the n-hop aggregated information on edges by node-to-edge layer and then we further decode the n-hop aggregated information layer by layer by n-layers back to get the output adjacency matrix.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
513,"(2) Different from image deconvolution, for each hidden channel, we have two filters vertical to each other, i.e., one is a column vector while the other is a row vector.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
514,"To get the nth hop information of edge <i,j>, row filter decodes all the (n+1)-th hop information of outgoing edges of node i and column filter decodes all the (n+1)-th hop information of incoming edges of node j.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
515,"(3) To make our description clearer, we have updated our paper in Section 3.2.2, e.g, by adding “To get the nth hop information Aij, row filter decodes all the (n+1)-th hop information of outgoing edges of Vi and column filter decodes all the (n+1)-th hop information of incoming edges of Vj.”",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5

522,Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
523,We would like to answer your questions in detail as follows:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
524,-----------------------------------------------------------------------,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
525,Q: The authors claim that their method is applicable for large graphs.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
526,"However, it seems the experiments do not seem to support this.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
527,"A: (1) We did not mention that we handle “large graph”, but instead we only mention that we handle “larger” graph.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
528,"In the domain of graph generation, currently, the proposed graph generative models can typically only deal with graphs with dozens of nodes or less (except GraphRNN which can scale to 300).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
529,"Compared to them, our model handles relatively “larger graph” (6-10 times larger than most existing methods).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
530,"(2) Translation in graphs is a new topic and we have not found many datasets in very large scale, so we do not test on much larger nodes. But the scalability experiments can still show the superiority of our model compared to others.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
531,(3) We typically test small-size graphs because most of the comparison methods can only handle small-size graphs.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
532,-----------------------------------------------------------------------,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
533,Q: It is not clear how the noise is introduced in the graphs. I would have expected to see some analysis and results on the translation quality over systematic noise applied to the input graph.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
534,A: Thanks for the review comment.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
535,(1) The noise is introduced by the dropout function in each convolution layer.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
536,Dropout functions by randomly ignore 50% of neuron’s output of a network in our mode by a uniform distribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
537,(2) The way we add noise,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
538,is well-recognized and commonly-used in generative deep learning models[1].,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
539,The noises added in GANs aim to enable the diversities in the generated graphs to avoid the problem that GANs tend to favor producing same output rather than spreading it evenly over the domain.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
540,(3) We have shown the analysis of the translation quality against noise in Figures 4 and 5.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,5,16
541,"In Figure 5 (see in the supplementary material), each logarithm plot in each column show the power-law trend of each randomly generated graph, which will look linear in such a logarithm plot.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
542,It can be seen that the generated graphs show the similar randomness pattern as the real graphs.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
543,"Moreover, the larger the graph is (see the graph size of 150), the smaller the randomness is, and the clearer the power-law trend is, which verifies that the translation quality of our method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16

547,Q: It is also not clear what are the assumptions made on the connectivity of the input graph and the target graph.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
548,Do we know how does the connectedness of the input graph affect the translation quality in the case of strongly connected directed graphs? Or what happens if the target graph has a strong connectivity?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
549,"Towards this, how does the computational complexity scale wrt to the connectedness?",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
550,"A: (1) Similar to all the existing graph deep generative learning methods for generic graphs, we do not have additional assumptions on the graphs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
551,"The domain of graph deep generative learning methods typically do not require to distinguish or preprocess specific topological types of graphs before applying it, no matter it is strongly- or weakly- connected graph, complete graph, planar graph, scale-free graph, or graphs that have other specific patterns.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

560,"1. For graph deconvolution, we have modified and reorganized the content.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
561,The Section 3.2.2 on “Graph Deconvolution” has been reorganized to two subsections “node-to-edge deconvolution” and “edge-to-edge deconvolution”.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
562,We also extended them to make the description on deconvolution operations clearer and more comprehensive.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
563,2.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
564,"For graph deconvolution, we have also added a new figure and refined the equations’ descriptions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5

577,"1. ""The clarity is below average. In Section 2 the main method is introduced. However, the motivation and benefits of introducing a parent and child variational approximation are not discussed adequately.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
578,"It would be helpful to move some of the stuff in the appendix to the main text, and present in a neat way.""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
579,We fully agree with this criticism. Following your suggestion (and also that of reviewer # 2) we have moved some material from the appendix to the main text.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,3,5
580,"2. ""I also struggled a little to understand what is the difference between forward interpolate and filtering""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
581,"In this work we refer by filtering to the process of inferring the optimal latent state z_t  at time t, using observations x_{1:t} from the trial up to time t, not including observations to the future of t. By forward interpolation we refer to the process of smoothing, (inferring optimal z_t from observations of the complete trial x_{1:T}, including points to the future of t), and then evolving the inferred z_t with the learned VIND dynamics.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
582,"After evolving for k steps, the Generative Model is used to generate data which is subsequently compared with the observations at time t+k.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
583,We do not refer to this procedure as “prediction” since the initial state z_t for the forward interpolation was obtained by making use of the full data.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
584,We have added clarifying comments at the beginning of section 4.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
585,"3. ""Given the existing body of literature, I found the technical novelty of this paper rather weak""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
586,We would like to reiterate that the novelty of the paper is <i>twofold.</i>,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
587,"First and foremost, we propose the use of a novel variational approximate posterior that shares the nonlinear dynamics with the generative model.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
588,This feature is powerful because it uses known information about the true posterior in the design of the approximate one.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
589,"Naively, the feature also seems to be a curse because the variational approximation is rendered intractable for the case of nonlinear dynamics.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
590,This is the reason why such approximate posteriors have not been proposed before.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
591,We have added a sentence in the introduction emphasizing this crucial point.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,5,12
592,"The second novelty is a method to deal with this intractability, via the Laplace approximation and the fixed-point iteration method.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
593,"We showed that the resulting algorithm, which intercalates a gradient step and a FPI step yields very good results in well-known, difficult tasks such as dimensionality expansion in the single cell data or the WFOM task.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
594,"4.- ""abstract: uncover nonlinear observation? -> maybe change ""observation"" to ""latent dynamics""?""",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
595,"The term ‘nonlinear observation’ in the line “…Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics (VIND), that is able to uncover nonlinear observation and transition functions from sequential data …“, found in the abstract refers to the observation map in the Generative Model.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
596,"That is, VIND uncovers both a nonlinear “observation” model, that maps nonlinearly a latent state to the data, and nonlinear latent dynamics mapping the latent state at time t to the state at time t+1, which we refer to as the “nonlinear transition functions”.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
597,"On the other hand, we agree that “nonlinear latent dynamics” is a better fit than “transition functions” for the abstract and we have performed this replacement.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,3,5
598,Thank you for your comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
599,- LSTM,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,16,14
600,LSTMs are indeed a strong model for tree prediction on previous tasks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
601,"To allow the model to access ancestry nodes during decoding, one way is to concatenate the parent node latent representation with the input of each step for decoding children, and then feed the concatenated vector to LSTM (e.g., Dong & Lapata ACL 2016).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
602,"However, since the ancestry has a variable-number of nodes (as decoding proceeds)",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
603,", to directly access these nodes during decoding, attentional mechanisms would be an efficient way, which is one of our motivations to use Transformer models that are attention-based.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
604,"Of course, LSTM equipped with Attention would achieve the same benefit.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
605,"In addition, positional encoding in Transformer also allows us to easily model spatial locations of UI elements.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
606,Our early experiments with LSTM did not yield good results on this spatial layout problem.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

610,We agree the IR-based metrics have limitations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
611,This is why we provided multiple eval metrics including edit distances and next-N accuracy.,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
612,The Edit Distance metric was designed by taking into account human factors in interaction tasks based on the key-stroke level GOMS models.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
613,We can clarify this further in the revision.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
614,Thank you for the review.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
615,"While the weight formats after model compression follow well known ones, our model compression method is significantly different from the existing ones.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
616,Let us discuss some parts of reasons.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
617,- Training models after compression in order to recover accuracy is as important (if not more) as compressing weights.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
618,"We have found that occasional distortions (not compressing weights for every mini-batch like previous techniques), relatively large learning rate, and training batches in full-precision (unlike previous ones which store compressed weights during entire training) would be the key to recovering or even increasing the accuracy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
619,- Exploring large search space in much wider area is suggested in this paper through large distortion step and large learning rate (note that many compression-aware techniques perform compression at every batch has distortion step of “1” while much smaller learning rate for retraining that normal training is chosen).,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
620,"As we discussed in the paper, investigating various local minima is crucial for good model compression.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
621,- Our pruning method is fundamentally different from the previous ones because we do not incorporate a masking layer.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
622,"While previous pruning ideas keep zero weights during training, we do not have any zero weights at any moment except at the weight distortion step.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
623,"- Our low-rank approximation is also unique one since 1) we do not alter the structure for training even after performing SVD, 2) very high learning rate associated with transient accuracy loss is allowed for DeepTwist, and 3) we change SV spectrum continuously while the previous ones perform SVD only once (in practice, retraining low-rank approximated model has been considered to be very difficult, if not impossible).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
624,"- Even though our pruning method is even simpler compared to the previous ones, compression rate is significantly better or very close to the one based on sophisticated Bayesian inference model.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
625,"- Low-rank approximation results on PTB (Figure 2) shows even higher compression rate compared with weight pruning (Table 3), which is surprising to us because pruning has been known to show much higher compression ratio compared with SVD (fine-grain vs. coarse-grain or structured).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
626,- Quantization is performed also in a very different way.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
627,"Unlike previous ones, we do not consider quatization during",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
628,"training. “Do not perform quantization at every batch, but instead recover accuracy through full-precision training, high learning rate, and occasional quantization” is the key message.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
629,"- Overall, our occasional compression is a significant one since we can greatly reduce amount of computation overhead from compression.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
630,"If our technique is a simple extension from the previous ones, we could not obtain such impressive results with high compression rate and improved accuracy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
631,We believe that our paper suggests a wide view on how model compression should be performed.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12

635,A1: We performed some additional experiments using the progressive gan generator [1] on CelebA-HQ dataset.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
636,"One interesting property of the progressive gan interpolations is that they take much longer to train to have a visual effect -- for example for color, we could obtain drastic color changes in Stylegan W latent space using as few as 2k samples, but with progressive gan, we used 60k samples and still did not obtain as strong of an effect.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
637,"This points to the Stylegan w latent space being more “flexible” and generalizable for transformation, compared to the latent space of progressive GAN.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
638,"Moreover, we qualitatively observe some entanglement in the progressive gan transformations -- for example, changing the level of zoom also changes the lighting.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
639,"We did not observe large effects for the shift transformations, although perhaps more hyperparameter tuning may improve these results.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
640,We have added a section B.6 in the appendix and figures illustrating these results.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
641,Q2: Does training the generator and interpolation jointly improve the quality of the generator in general?,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
642,A2: This is an interesting question.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
643,We are in the process of investigating this hypothesis to see if sampling from both the latent space and transformation alpha can help improve sample diversity and potentially FID.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,7,1

814,Ullrich et al. introduce some of the same foundational building blocks for applying differentiable models to the cryoEM reconstruction task.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
815,"In particular, they propose a differentiable voxel-based representation for the volume and introduce a variational inference algorithm for learning the volume through gradient-based optimization.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
816,"Due to their voxel-based representation, they introduce a method to differentiate through the 2D projection operator.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
817,"In contrast, we parametrically learn a continuous function for volume via a coordinate-based MLP, which seamlessly allows differentiation through the slicing and rotation operators without having to deal with discretization.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
818,"Their method is able to learn a homogeneous volume with given poses, whereas we perform fully unsupervised reconstruction of heterogeneous volumes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
819,They show empirical experiments that highlight many of the challenges for variational inference of these models.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
820,"In particular, inference of the unknown pose is challenging with gradient-based optimization and contains many local minima (their Fig 6), which we address with a branch and bound algorithm.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
821,"We report a Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) metric, which is a commonly used resolution metric in the cryoEM field.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
822,Voxel-wise MSE is not typically used in the cryoEM literature as it is sensitive to background subtraction and data normalization.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
823,We have added training times for these methods to the SI.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
824,2. The normalization constant in Eq. 3 is the partition function over all possible values of the latent pose and volume.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

836,- On Notation:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
837,+ We now have an introductory sentence to our notation section to improve the flow of reading and in order to not open the section with bullet points right away.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
838,+ As you suggested we changed our inequality notation to curly brackets to make it visually clearer that we are dealing with vectors.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
839,"+ In fact we did introduce our subscript notation of the kind ""b |_{y>0}"".",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
840,It is defined in our section on notation.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
841,Nevertheless your troubles compelled us to restate the meaning of this notation at the time of its first usage.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5

843,- On Omnidirectionality:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
844,We are glad that you seem to find the concept of omnidirectionality intriguing. In the new version of our paper we therefore tried hard to make the definition as intelligible and intuitive as possible.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,14,5
845,"We now use the following, equivalent, formulation as our definition: The matrix A of the form m x n is omnidirectional if for every given x in R^n \ {0} there exists a row A_i of A such that <A_i, x> > 0.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
846,Or in less formal terms: There is no open linear half-space in R^n that does not contain an A_i.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
847,"This geometric formulation of the definition is not only the origin of the naming, but it is also a mathematically sound formulation similar to the one you suggested “A is full rank and there does not exist any X such that Ax < 0”.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
848,The problem with your formulation (from the point of view of our notation) lies in the usage of the inequality sign since we defined it in the notation section to be element-wise.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
849,"Your formulation would therefore require every entry of Ax to be negative, while for omnidirectionality one entry would be sufficient as long as the others are non-positive.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
850,This miscommunication also encouraged us to change our signs to the curly version as suggested by you.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
851,"The original reason we used the previous definition was that we thought it would show more clearly what the core property is, namely that omnidirectionality can be used to nail down one precise solution. But we are now convinced that the best introductory formulation is the geometric one, as it offers an intuition of omnidirectionality.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

855,"+ We corrected as many typos as we could find, we would be very thankful for pointing out any further typos!",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,14,5
856,+ We tried to improve the readability by increasing structure of longer segments of text e.g. by introducing informal titles.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
857,+ We added a clear and formal definition of the “binary” diagonal matrices representing the application of ReLU.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5

885,"We consider a joint training (JT, classical training) of the discriminator as the upper performance bound.",reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11
886,Joint training features a setup in which the discriminator is trained on ALL real samples of the previous tasks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11
887,The reviewer proposes to simulate information loss and use a random subset of real samples to train the upper bound model.,reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,15,11
888,"However, this would certainly give a worse performance than when using all real samples.",reb_fine,rebuttal_refute-question,11.0,1,11

892,"As explained in Sec. 5.2, this can be attributed to a potentially higher diversity with steady quality of the generated samples.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
893,"Clearly, the performance of the classifier trained on the generated samples highly depends on the complexity of the task and quality of the generated samples.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
894,"Thus, this effect can be observed neither in the SVHN nor the CIFAR10 benchmarks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

899,"Noteworthy, the discriminator is not affected by the proposed dynamic network expansion mechanism and features the same architecture as in the benchmark methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

917,We address them as follows.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
918,1. We first would like to point out the contributions of our work.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
919,"First, we address the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
920,Thereby we introduce Dynamic Generative Memory (DGM) - an adversarially trainable generative network endowed with neuronal plasticity through efficient learning of sparse attention mask for layer activations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
921,Hereby we extend the idea of HAT[2] to generative networks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
922,"Secondly, we address the scalability problem in continual learning.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
923,"To ensure sufficient model capacity to accommodate for new tasks, we propose an adaptive network expansion mechanism in which newly added capacity is derived from the learnable neuron masks.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
924,2. We further we would like to clarify a possible confusion of the proposed method to be a combination of Deep Generative Replay (DGR)[6] and HAT[2].,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
925,"As pointed out in the Sec. 2 of our work, Deep Generative Replay (DGR) tries to prevent forgetting in the generator by retraining it from scratch every time a new data chunk becomes available.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
926,"Thus, in DGR the generator would lose information at each replay step since the quality of generated samples highly depends on the quality of samples generated by the prior generator causing ""semantic drift"".",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
927,"This contrasts our method, which effectively retains the knowledge in the generator using HAT like neuron masking and only loses information through “natural” forgetting.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
928,This allows us to use “complete” learned representation during learning and inference of the subsequent tasks as well as speed up the training (no replay of G is involved).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
929,3. We are not simply shifting the forgetting problem into G.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
930,Our work tackles the problem of class incremental learning.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
931,"As opposed to task-incremental setup and shown in previous work, e.g. [3,4,5], models in class incremental setup (with single-head architecture) require a replay of previously seen categories when learning new ones.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
932,The reason for using G,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
933,is not having access to samples of previous classes in the “strict” incremental setup and using generated samples instead.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
934,"As pointed out in our work, restricting storage of real samples represents a more realistic setup, since in real-world applications such an “episodic memory” with real samples is often impossible due to memory and privacy restrictions.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

960,Thank you for your comments and questions.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
961,Classical cryo-EM reconstruction algorithms (e.g. cryoSPARC) are described in Section 2.2 at a high level and we refer the reader to its reference (Punjani et al. 2017) for more details on their implementation.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
962,"To clarify the relationship between the cryoSPARC and cryoDRGN heterogeneous reconstruction in Figure 4, CryoSPARC imposes a discrete model for heterogeneity, specifically a mixture model of K volumes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
963,The cryoSPARC results in Figure 4 are the volumes and the distribution of images over the 3 clusters from their unsupervised reconstruction.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
964,"In contrast, the continuous latent variable from cryoDRGN unsupervised reconstruction is able to reconstruct the continuous motion of the ground truth volume.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

968,We uploaded a revised version of the paper based on the comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,5,16
969,- The reason behind using V-GMM is that V-GMM is much faster than KDE in inference and has a better generalization ability compared to GMM.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
970,We use V-GMM as a proof of concept for the idea “Curiosity-Driven Experience Prioritization via Density Estimation”.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
971,Other density estimation methods can also be applied.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
972,We now clarify these reasons in Section “2.3 Density Estimation Methods” of the revised paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
973,- We concatenate the goals and estimate the trajectory density instead of state density because HER needs to sample a future state in the trajectory as a virtual goal for training.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
974,"- For episodes of different length, we can pad or truncate the trajectories into same lengths and apply V-GMM.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1076,"1.

1346,And this is separately validated across multiple classes of modulations.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1347,"But indeed, as you point out, we cannot guarantee that the improvements we see are purely due to exploration.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
1348,"At the same time, it’s worth recognising that, by design, the method proposed will try to cater to the underlying learning algorithm and would ideally generate samples that would benefit the underlying learning procedure.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1349,We will highlight this ambiguity in the revised paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
1350,Main comment 2:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1351,"Sorry, this was not very clear: The performance outcome for each variant is measured on multiple independent runs (seeds).",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,15,3
1352,"All outcomes are then jointly ranked, and the corresponding ranks are averaged across seeds.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1353,"Finally, these averaged ranks are normalized to fall between 0 and 1.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1354,A normalized rank of 1 corresponds to all the N outcomes (seeds) of a variant being ranked at the top N positions in the joint ranking.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1355,Figure 4 then further aggregates these normalized ranks across 15 Atari games.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1356,Note that these joining rankings are done separately per subplot (ie modulation class).,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
1357,Thus the reason that no fixed arm is always good does not depend on the inter-seed variability as much as on the fact that the best arm differs in different games.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1358,We will clarify this in the caption too.,reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
1359,"The bandit does not generally do better than the best fixed arm in hindsight -- in general, this would still need to be identified --",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1360,"but it is not far off, and it handily outperforms untuned arms, allowing us to remove some of the hyper-parameter tuning burden.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1361,Additional question 1:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1362,We acknowledge that our presentation focused maybe more than necessary on ideal scenarios that use learning progress LP(z) while the practical version used a (maybe disappointingly) simplistic choice of proxy f(z).,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
1363,"The updated paper will change the emphasis, and clarify that a closer, more faithful, learning progress proxy remains future work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_by-cr,2.0,2,2
1364,"We will also clarify that the little phrase “After initial experimentation, we opted for the simple proxy…” implies quite extensive experimentation with other plausible proxies that looked promising in individual environments but were not consistently effective across the suite of Atari games.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,2,1
1365,Additional question 2:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1366,"Of course, even an ideal metric LP(z) would remain a local quantity, and pursuing it would not guarantee the maximal final performance -- but it is valuable if local optima are not the prime concern.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1367,"Performance plateaus are a nuisance in general, and within the simple space of modulations we consider, there is no magic bullet to escape them.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1368,"However, our approach does the next best thing: when performance becomes an uninformative (ie on a plateau), it encourages maximal diversity of behaviour (tending toward uniform probabilities over z), with the hope that some modulation gets lucky -- and then as soon as that happens, very quickly focusing on that modulation to repeat the lucky episode until learning is progressing again.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1494,thank you for your positive review and constructive feedback!,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1495,We agree that the structure of the paper was not optimal and reorganized it along the lines you suggested (thanks for the suggestion!).,reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,3,3
1496,Below we address specific questions.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1497,“I am a bit unclear about how comparisons are made to other methods that do not optimize for small numbers of parameters? Do you compare against the lowest error network found by LEMONADE? The closest match in # of parameters?”,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1498,-> The latter: we compared with the models with the closest match in # of parameters.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,5,1
1499,“Why is the second objective log(#params) instead of just #params when the introduction mentions explicitly that tuning the scales between different objectives is not needed in LEMONADE?”,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1500,"-> We stated that defining a trade-off between objectives is not necessary (in case you are referring to this statement), which would, e.g., be necessary when one would scalarize objectives by using a weighted sum.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1501,"Rescaling an objective, however, is different as it is independent from other objectives: it only depends on that specific objective and which scale is important to the user and the application.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1502,"For the number of parameters, the log scale is natural to cover a large range of sizes: think of a plot of size vs. performance; in order to see anything for small sizes one would typically put the size on a log scale (and we indeed did, see, e.g., Figures 3 and 4).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1503,"Therefore, it is most natural to also put the number of parameters on a log scale for LEMONADE.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1504,"“It seems like LEMONADE would scale poorly to more than 2 objectives, since it effectively requires approximating an #objectives-1 dimensional surface with the population of parents. How could scaling be handled?”",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1505,"-> We think having 4-6 objectives is a realistic dimensionality for NAS applications, and scaling to significantly more objectives (which would indeed be problematic for our method, but also for multi-objective optimization in general) is typically not necessary.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1506,"In response to this question, to demonstrate this, wee conducted a new experiment with 5 objectives (performance on Cifar 10, performance on Cifar 100, number of parameters, number of multiply-add operations, inference time) to show that LEMONADE can handle these realistic scenarios natively.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1598,"We respectfully disagree with the referee’s conclusions, and will elaborate on the above statements in the following.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,2,12
1599,"While we disagree, we did however undertake a significant effort to further clarify and provide additional evidence in the revised manuscript, taking into account these comments.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
1600,"Regarding the theoretical correctness of deep probabilistic subsampling, in section 3.2 we explain how we incorporate a well-known reparametrization trick, termed the Gumbel-max trick (Gumbel,1954), to sample from a categorical probability distribution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1601,Note that this shares similarities with the reparameterization trick used for sampling from trained gaussian distributions in a vanilla variational autoencoder.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1602,"The Gumbel-max reparametrization perturbs the logits of the categorical distribution with Gumbel noise after which, by means of the argmax, the highest value is selected.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1603,Gumbel (1954) showed that this reparametrization allows sampling from the original categorical distribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1604,"Recent state-of-the art work on a relaxation of this trick, termed Gumbel-softmax sampling (Jang et al., 2017) or the concrete distribution (Maddison et al., 2016), allows us to apply this relaxed reparametrization inside a neural network as it enables gradient calculation, which is needed for error backpropagation in the training procedure of the network.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1605,We would like to ask the reviewer what is believed to be missing from this explanation on the subsampling part of our proposed method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1606,Regarding the theoretical basis used for the design of the task network; we took a theoretically principled approach by exploiting a model-driven network architecture for the CIFAR10 reconstruction problem.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1607,"To that end, we unfold the iterations of a proximal gradient scheme (Mardani et al., NeurIPS, 2018), allowing for explicit embedding of the acquisition model (and therewith the learned sampling) in the reconstruction network.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1608,Regarding the referee’s conclusion that the manuscript lacks comparison to the approaches of (Xie & Ermon (2019); Kool et al. (2019); Plötz & Roth (2018): We would like to point out that these three references all together put forward the Gumbel top-k method.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1609,"Note that the use of the Gumbel top-k method for compressive sampling is also new, and in fact constitutes a specific case (constrained version with shared weights across distributions) of the proposed deep probabilistic subsampling (DPS) framework.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1610,"In the MNIST experiments we already included Gumbel top-k sampling, but we will also add this for the other experiments in the revised manuscript.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,2,12
1611,"In addition, we added a thorough comparison of the DPS to LOUPE (Bahadir et al, 2019), a recently proposed data-driven method for subsampling.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,5,12
1612,Question 2:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1613,"We would first like to refer the referee to third paragraph of the introduction, where we explicitly formulate the main shortcoming of compressed sensing:",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1614,"“These [compressed sensing] methods, however, are lacking in the sense that they do not fully exploit both the underlying data distribution and information to solve the downstream task of interest.”",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1615,"Then, in the list of main contributions, we write:",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1616,“DPS: A new regime for task-adaptive subsampling using a novel probabilistic deep learning framework for jointly learning a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme with a predictive model for downstream tasks”,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1617,Subquestion 2:,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1618,We are of course willing to further specify any details that the referee misses in the current paper. We would therefore like to kindly invite the referee to be specific about the details that he/she would like to be added to the manuscript.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
1619,We respectfully disagree with the referee’s conclusion that the method does not support a significant contribution.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,3,12
1620,"We propose a fully-probabilistic generative model for trainable sampling, that exploits both the underlying data distribution and information to solve the downstream task of interest.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1621,"Our generative model builds upon recent advances on Gumbel max and top-k reparameterizations and their relaxations, showing for the first time how discrete sample selection can be done in a data-driven and task-adaptive fashion.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1622,This opens up a vast array of new opportunities in compressed sensing.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1623,Thank you for the review.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1624,"While formulating a proximal function for model compression might be an interesting idea (if search space is highly limited) as the reviewer suggested, we believe that our proposed method is fundamentally different from proximal gradient descent approaches due to the following reasons:",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1625,1) Proximal gradient descent is meant to solve a convex optimization problem while our aim is to solve a non-convex problem in which each local minimum exhibits vastly different test accuracy after compression.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1626,Jumping to another local minimum from a certain minimum would not be easily achieved by convex optimization methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1627,2) Finding a particular flat minimum is the key to obtaining good model compression (and good generalization as well).,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1628,"Such an exploration, however, cannot be obtained by a proximal function since we need to investigate lots of different local minima with different amount of flatness in loss surface.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1629,"3) While proximal gradient descent can be useful to find a certain local minimum close to the starting point given a convex constraint, wide exploration (associated with possibly transient accuracy loss in the initial training as shown in Figure 2.(b)) is necessary to escape from a point with sharp loss surface.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1630,Investigating many different local minima would be only available with large learning rate (as we have chosen for our experiments) and/or large amount of weight distortion.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1631,"4) Our effort to introduce optimal distortion step size and learning rate for a given compression problems is connected to exploration, not exploitation (which potentially supported by proximal functions where convergence matters).",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1632,"Even though proximal gradient descent selects step size only considering convergence, Figure 1 can lead to the results such as Figure 2(b) which cannot be obtained if only local exploitation is employed.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1633,"Finding a flat minimum has been known to be a difficult work as shown in the paper “On large-batch training for deep learning: generalization gap and sharp minima”, ICLR 2016.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1634,We firmly believe that our search space exploration method based on optimal distortion step size and amount of weight distortion enable us to produce better local minima well-suited to various model compression techniques.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1635,"In short, unfortunately, we have failed to understand how you could connect our technique to proximal functions and proximal gradient descent.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1636,We strongly hope that you reconsider your decision.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1637,> This suggests that PointGoal navigation with dense GPS signal is might be a poor choice to benchmark RL algorithms and we should proceed to harder tasks.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1638,Agreed.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
1639,"We hope that our algorithm, DD-PPO, and our pretrained models will help accelerate progress on harder tasks like PointGoal Navigation without GPS+Compass, ObjectGoal/RoomGoal Navigation, Instruction Following, etc.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,14,1
1640,[Q] The paper presents a novel hierarchical clustering method over an embedding space.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1641,"In the presented approach, both the embedding space and the hierarchical clustering are simultaneously learned.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1642,The hierarchical clustering algorithm aims to recover complex clustering hierarchies which cannot be captured by previously proposed methods.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1643,"[A1] Dear Reviewer 1, thank you for the thoughtful review.",reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14

1645,"Many works on flat-clustered representation learning except for VAE-nCRP, has been limited to capture flat-level data structure.",reb_fine,rebuttal_other,10.0,1,10
1646,"[Q] The paper address a relevant problem, which is of great interest for extracting knowledge from data.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1647,"[A1] There are a lot of high-dimensional data around us, and it obviously contains complex structures inside. What we would like to argue through this study is that we can analyze the complex structure of data in the embedding space learned by a deep neural network.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1648,"[Q] In general, the quality of the paper is high.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1649,The presented approach is based on a sound formalization of hierarchical clustering and deep generative models.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1650,The paper is easy to follow in spite of the technical difficulty.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1651,The experimental evaluation is really extensive.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1652,It compares against many state-of-the-art methods. And the results are promising from both a quantitative and qualitative point view.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1653,[A1] Thank you for the comment.,reb_fine,rebuttal_accept-praise,0.0,14,0

1658,"We empirically observed the performance improvement of both density estimation and hierarchical clustering, which motivates the joint optimization.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1659,"Additionally, we qualitatively showed embedding plot, image generation, and result hierarchy with various datasets.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1660,"[Q] The only issue with this paper is its degree of novelty, which is narrow.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1661,"The proposed method adapt a previously presented hierarchical clustering method in the ""standard space"" (Griffiths et al., 2004) to an embedding space defined by a variational autoencoder model.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1662,"The inference algorithm builds on standard techniques of deep generative models and, also, on previously proposed methods (Wand and Blei, 2003) for dealing with the complex hierarchical priors involved in this kind of models.",reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,1,15
1663,"[A1] As the reviewer pointed out, we adopted the partial components with the previously proposed techniques or methodologies.",reb_fine,rebuttal_concede-criticism,3.0,1,3
1664,The theoretical contribution of our study can be considered in conjunction with the unified model based on the fully Bayesian approach of the probabilistic graphical model and the neural network.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1665,"Additionally, we tuned the several detailed heuristic algorithms for operations such as GROW, PRUNE, and MERGE.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,5,16
1666,"Also, if we take a naive pipelined approach of iterative training between the hierarchical Gaussian mixture model and representation learning, then this work would be an obviously incremental work.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,15,12
1667,"[A2] VAE imposes a single Gaussian prior on embeddings, which leads to 1) the over-regularization, and 2) poor representations [1,2,5].",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1670,"Therefore, the recently published researches can be divided into two branches: 1) designing of an objective function by introducing the additional regularized terms, or 2) constructing of a more flexible prior.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1681,We would like to thank you for the review and comments.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1682,We revised the manuscript to address your concerns.,reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
1683,Below we summarized your concerns/questions with our answers.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1684,Q1: Some arguments that are presented could deserve a bit more precision.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1685,A1: We acknowledge that quantization is a very active research area in model compression and there are numerous quantization techniques with unique and distinct characteristics.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
1686,We could not introduce and discuss lots of exciting quantization techniques such as vector quantization due to the limited space.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1687,"We feel that introducing other quantization techniques in details would make the paper distracted since those techniques cannot be compared with compression ratio only (i.e., inference architecture, computation methods, and storage design would be different).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1688,"Instead, we added more thorough introduction to binary codes in Section 1 to explain unique computational advantages of using binary codes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,5,5
1689,"We introduced ""Hardware-aware Automated Quantization with Mixed Precision"" in Section 1 since fractional quantization on average is available as you pointed out, while FleXOR can also employ different quantization bits for each layer (i.e., we believe HAQ method can be applied on top of FleXOR).",reb_fine,rebuttal_done,5.0,1,5
1690,Q2: More extensive and thorough experiments could improve the impact of the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1691,A2: We agree that including extensive quantization methods and model architectures would greatly improve the impact of the paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
1692,"Unfortunately, as we discussed above, our goal in this paper is to improve quantization schemes based on binary codes.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
1693,Including quantization methods of different assumptions may require much lengthy discussions that make comparisons a lot complicated.,reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-request,13.0,1,13
1694,"For example, ""Hardware-aware Automated Quantization"" could be additionally applied to binary codes, and FleXOR is not conflicted with such an architectural techniques to improve compression ratio.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1695,"Deep compression, TTQ, and TWN involve weight pruning that deserves large space for discussions (nonetheless, we compared TWN, TTQ, and BinaryRelax using ternary quantization scheme in Table 5 of Appendix).",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1696,Deep compression also includes CSR format and Huffman coding which would make comparisons more complicated.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1697,"We chose a few representative quantization methods mainly based on binary codes to facilitate fair and focused comparisons, and correspondingly, ResNet models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are selected for our experiments since most previous works (of binary codes) commonly include those models.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1698,"For example, we could not include HAQ in the paper for experimental results, because HAQ chooses MobileNet and ResNet-50 only as model architectures while comparisons are made with only PACT and Deep Compression methods.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1699,Q3: Providing some code and numbers for inference time would be great.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

1701,Please refer to our message available to the reviewers only.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1

1709,"So we conjecture that one can relax the assumptions and introduce the notions like ``locally twice differentiable'' and ``locally smooth Hessian'', meaning that the assumptions only need to hold in the region of the saddle points.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12
1710,"Since the gradient norm in the region of the saddle points is small, it implies that the Hessian should not change too much and ``locally smooth Hessian'' should make sense.",reb_fine,rebuttal_reject-criticism,12.0,1,12

1722,We hope this rebuttal can address your concerns.,reb_fine,rebuttal_social,14.0,14,14
1723,Major concern: Trained sampling vs random sampling,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1724,"We sample architectures every a few epochs, mainly because in our experiments, we want to analyze the behavior of the architecture distribution at different super net training epochs.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1725,This analysis is illustrated in figure 3 of our paper.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1726,"We can see that at epoch-0, where the architecture distribution is trained for only one epoch (close to random sampling), the sampled architectures have much lower compression rate.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1728,"In comparison, at epoch-79 and epoch-89, architectures have higher compression rates and accuracy.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1729,The difference between epoch-79 vs. epoch-89 is small since the distribution has converged.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1730,"As the reviewer#2 suggests, we can train the super net until the last epoch, then sample and train architectures from this distribution.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1731,"Figure 3 shows that the five architectures sampled at epoch-89 are much better than the five architectures at epoch-0, which are essentially drawn from random sampling.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
1732,"Also, note that for CIFAR10-ResNet-110 experiments, the search space contains 7^54 = 4x10^45 possible architectures, 45 sampled architectures are tiny compared with the search space.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
1733,Reviewer #2 suggests comparing with a “cost-aware” random sampling policy.,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15

1737,"The performance of this policy is much worse since for a conv operator with precision-0 (in our notation, bit-0 denotes we skip the layer), the sampling probability is 33x higher than full-precision convolution, 2x higher than 1-bit, 3x higher than 2-bit, and so on.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1738,Architectures sampled from this distribution are extremely small but with much worse accuracy.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1739,We understand this might not be the best “cost-aware” sampling policy.,reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,1,16
1740,"If reviewer#1 has better suggestions, we are happy to try.",reb_fine,rebuttal_summary,16.0,14,16
1741,Minor concern #1: Value of the Gumbel Softmax function,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1
1742,Yes. We agree with the comments that the advantages of the Gumbel Softmax technique are two-fold:,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,3,1
1743,1. It makes the loss function differentiable with respect,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,15,1

1816,"If the correlation of some rows is arbitrarily small (but non-zero) between remaining and removed rows, the upper bounds can be arbitrarily small.",reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1

1823,-Q: Actionable consequences from paper:,reb_fine,rebuttal_structuring,15.0,15,15
1824,One consequence of our paper is that it is close to impossible (each layer need at least to double the number of neuron) to enforce invertibility and it is similarly hard to enforce compactness in ReLU layers.,reb_fine,rebuttal_answer,1.0,1,1
