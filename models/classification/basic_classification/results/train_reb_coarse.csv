375,This would allow us to show similar local convergence guarantees to those proven by other works in the area (see Appendix A).,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
376,"However, as the reviewer points out as well, the HGD analysis is also useful because it implies similar convergence results for CO, which is a practical algorithm.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

389,Please could the reviewer clarify why they felt our work muddies the debate regarding large-batch training?,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
390,We demonstrate that one can initially increase the batch size with no loss in test accuracy by simultaneously increasing the learning rate.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
391,However for very large batch sizes the test accuracy degrades under both constant epoch and constant step budgets.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
392,We agree that some of our observations under constant epoch budgets in sections 2 and 3 have been made in previous work.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
393,However there are also several important differences:,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
394,1.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
395,Our paper is the first to relate the two regimes of SGD to the popular analogy between SGD and stochastic differential equations (SDEs).,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
396,"As we show in sections 4 and 5, this perspective is crucial to understanding the influence of batch size and learning rate on test accuracy.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
397,A common criticism of this analogy is that SGD noise is not Gaussian when the batch size is small.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
398,"To our knowledge, we are the first to show that the analogy between SGD and SDEs holds for non-Gaussian short-tailed noise (appendix B).",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
399,2. Zhang et al. argued that Momentum only helps in the large batch limit.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
400,"However, their analysis is based on the noisy quadratic model, which cannot explain the results we observed on the test set in sections 4 and 5.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,1,1
401,"These experiments clearly demonstrate that, unlike the SDE perspective, the noisy quadratic model is not an appropriate model for predicting test set performance in deep learning.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,1,1
402,Their work also does not clarify the assumptions under which linear scaling of the learning rate should arise.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,1,1
403,"3. Our empirical results in section 3 are similar to Shallue et al., however their work argues that there is no reliable relationship between learning rate and batch size.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
404,"We draw a very different conclusion: the learning rate usually obeys linear scaling, but linear scaling only holds theoretically when the assumptions we specify are satisfied.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
405,"Linear scaling may not hold in cases where these assumptions break down (e.g., language modelling).",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
406,"4. The observation that the test accuracy is independent of batch size in the noise dominated regime is a natural consequence of the SDE analogy, since any two training runs which integrate the same SDE should sample final parameters from the same probability distribution.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2

414,"Indeed in their abstract, they state ‘We find no evidence that larger batch sizes degrade out-of-sample performance’.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
415,"In another recent paper, Zhang et al. argued that optimization in deep learning is well described by a noisy quadratic model which predicts that increasing the batch size should always enhance performance under constant step budgets.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
416,"Crucially, to establish that SGD noise enhances generalization, one must show that small batch sizes generalize better than large batch sizes under constant step budgets, with realistic learning rate decay schedules, and one must independently tune the learning rate at each batch size.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
417,"In section 4, we are the first authors to perform this experiment and confirm that the final test accuracy of SGD does degrade for very large batch sizes under both constant epoch and constant step budgets, contradicting the claims of both Shallue et al and Zhang et al.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,1,1
418,"Furthermore, we show in section 5 that the optimal SGD temperature which maximizes the test accuracy is almost independent of the epoch budget.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1

1053,We thank Reviewer 2 for the constructive feedback.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1054,Here is our point-to-point response to the comments and questions raised in the review:,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1055,"1. “It is unclear to me whether the ""efficient method for SN in convolutional nets"" is more efficient than the power iteration algorithm employed in previous work, such as Miyato et al. 2018, which also used SN in conv nets with different strides. There is no direct comparison of performance.”",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1056,"We do not claim that our method is more efficient than Miyato et al.’s method, which uses the spectral norm of the convolution kernel matrix to approximate the spectral norm of the convolution operation.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1057,"In fact, our proposed method is computationally more expensive than their approximate scheme because each power iteration in our method requires a conv/deconv operation rather than a simple division used by Miyato et al.’s.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1058,We introduce our new spectral normalization scheme for convolutional layers because there exist examples where the true spectral norm of a convolution operation can be arbitrarily larger than Miyato et al.’s approximation.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1059,"Therefore, Miyato et al.’s normalization scheme is not guaranteed to control the spectral norm of convolutional layers which is critical for controlling a DNN’s generalization performance (please see our generalization bounds in Section 3).",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1060,"To further support our argument, we performed additional experiments demonstrating how our proposed method better controls the spectral norm of convolution layers, resulting in better generalization and test performance.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1061,The results are presented in Appendix A.1.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1062,"Furthermore, we run several experiments to show that our method is not significantly slower than Miyato et al.’s method, and we report the results in Appendix A.1, Table 3.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1

1067,3. “The epsilons in Fig. 5 have very different scales (0 - 0.5 vs. 0 - 5). Are these relevant to the specific algorithms and why?”,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1068,"Yes, the epsilons are chosen to be different depending on whether we are looking at norm_inf attacks or norm_2 attacks.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1069,This is because the two norms can behave very differently in adversarial attack experiments.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

1797,In that response we address the following issues:,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1798,(1) We emphasize fundamental differences between Cakewalk and CE.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1799,These go beyond the differences the reviewer mentions.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1800,"(2) How the sampling distribution should not be considered as a part of Cakewalk, and that it is mostly provided as an example, and a basis for the reported experiments.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1801,(3) The experiments include results two tasks.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1802,"Nonetheless, it appears the paper doesn’t convey this clearly, and we suggest two possible ways how to update the paper in this regard.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1803,"Next, we try to answer the specific issues the reviewer mentions.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1804,"First, we address the suggestion of introducing Cakewalk as a generalization of CE.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1805,While we were writing the paper we in fact considered presenting Cakewalk as the reviewer suggests.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1806,"We eventually decided against this approach as CE is a method for adapting an importance sampler, and its convergence guarantees only apply when it is treated as such.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1807,The convergence guarantees of REINFORCE on the other hand still apply under our surrogate objective framework.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1808,"This property allows us to explore various surrogates, where one such construction allows us to interpret CE as a policy gradient method, and another makes the basis for Cakewalk.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1809,"Second, we address the issue of using a sampling distribution that assumes independence between the different dimensions.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1810,"As the author correctly states, such a distribution will not always be useful, and one can design a problem for which this distribution will lead to a poor local optimum.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1811,Note however that a global maximizer for the objective suggested by the reviewer can be easily found just by random sampling: sampling such a maximizer has the same probably as sampling an odd integer - half.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1812,"Nonetheless, for the clique problem such a distribution can be effective.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1813,"Intuitively, if some node i is part of a large clique, then sampling x_i=1 is likely to result in a good objective as there are many nodes that are connected to i, and the chance of not sampling any of them decreases with the clique size.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1814,"In this way, over time the probability for sampling such nodes becomes higher, and the chance of sampling all of them together increases.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1815,A similar reasoning applies for the k-medoids problem.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1816,We note that these kind of factorized distributions have a long history of being useful in machine learning.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1817,"In a similar context to the one studied in the paper, such distributions have been studied by Rubinstein in his paper which discusses CE as an algorithm for combinatorial optimization, and in the classical bandit papers Exp3 is applied independently to several dimensions to study game theoretic problems.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1818,"In different contexts, such distributions have also been used as naive mean field approximations in variational inference.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1819,"Next, we address the question regarding the gradient update types.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1820,One intuitive explanation for why an algorithm that maintains a ‘memory’ of previous gradient updates like AdaGrad or Adam is required,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1821,is that they protect against sampling biases.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1822,"Consider for example the case when the execution is at the start, and the sampling distribution still has maximum entropy.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1823,"Due to the combinatorial nature of the solution space, the examples that have been sampled thus far create a distorted representation of the solution space.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1824,"In this case we could get that some x_i=j will occur few times, while some other x_k will not receive the value j at all.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1825,Now if we apply vanilla gradient updates this can skew the sampling distribution in random directions.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1826,Gradient updates such as those of AdaGrad and Adam on the other hand will lessen the impact of such deviations as the importance of each case is inversely proportional to the number of previous observations.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1827,"As such deviations will inevitably occur whenever we rely on polynomially sized samples to represent a combinatorial solution space, without such corrections a gradient based adaptive sampling algorithm will almost surely fail.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1828,"Indeed, as can be seen in tables 1,2 and 4, SGA almost never leads to a locally optimal solution.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,1,2
1829,"Furthermore, this reasoning explains why AdaGrad is superior to Adam: AdaGrad corrects against sampling biases that entail all the examples that have been encountered, while Adam does this only within some exponentially moving time window.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1830,"Indeed, this phenomenon is studied in detail in the AdaGrad paper (though without assuming a data distribution), and sparse data like ours (one can say our data points are N indicator vectors of length M) is the first motivating example in their paper.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

2709,We thank the reviewer for their review.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2710,We address the different remarks below.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2711,"“It is unclear whether the data augmentation techniques is applied only at training time or also at test time. In other words: at test time, do you present the original images only or transformed images too?”",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2712,We apply the data augmentation both at training and test time.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
2713,"“In section 4, it is unclear why only the maximal activation of the softmax layer is used to characterize a sample? Why not considering the full distribution that should contain richer information? Why just focusing on the output layer and why not using the info available at intermediate layers?”",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2714,"We agree that the full distribution of the softmax layer provides more information, but there is no straightforward way to extend the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance to multi-dimensional distributions, beyond the two- and three-dimensional cases.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
2715,"We focus on confidence as a proxy to the loss, and we assume that the loss is the quantity that should be the most different between training and testing, as the optimization phase explicitly minimizes the loss on the training set.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
2716,"Moreover, early experiments showed that using the outputs of intermediate layers provide no improvement for membership inference (on preliminary CIFAR-10 experiments, we obtained respectively 67.7 accuracy with the output layer and 66.5 when using all layers).",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
2717,"“Section 5 is somewhat less clear than the previous sections. The authors should more clearly define what the private, public and evaluation sets are, right from the beginning. The purpose of the public set is explained only in section 5.2.”",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2

2721,This seems to be too low to be of practical use.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2722,This might be because the Bayes and MAT attacks are too simplistic.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2723,"Again, why not using the distribution of the outputs of all layers? Why focusing only on the output of the last layer?”",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2724,"We agree that better performance could be obtained by running the initial model for more epochs, but our goal is to stay close to the standard training of Imagenet models, i.e. 90 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.1, divided by 10 every 30 epochs.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
2725,"We emphasize that the last line of Table 3 corresponds to the most difficult setup, where the network has been trained with a strong data-augmentation, and we only use the intermediate layers of the network (which amounts to less than 62% of the parameters for e.g. Resnet101), this is why the performance is significantly impacted.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2

3552,"Our approach is conceptually different since the regularizer proposed by (Mescheder et al 2018) is an (isotropic) ambient regularizer in the input space, whereas the regularizer we used performs (anisotropic) smoothing on the manifold parametrized by the latent generative model.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1

5108,These prescriptions are absent for the optimizers considered in the paper.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
5109,"Therefore, we define them from either mathematical reasoning (say learning rate is non-negative, $\beta_1, \beta_2$ in Adam are between (0, 1) and close to 1) or using the calibration step, where we determine those distributions by fitting on the configurations that yielded reasonably good results.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

5289,We are certain that the data processing inequality is used correctly.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2

5296,> [...],reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5297,the major problem of this paper is that it uses the data processing inequality (DPI) in a **wrong** way.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
5298,"As in (Cover and Thomas, 2012), which is also cited in this paper, DPI is defined on a Markov chain X -> Y -> Z and we have I(X,Y) >= I(X,Z).",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
5299,"However, based on the definition of \theta and \tilde{\theta} given in the first sentence of section 2.3, the relation between \theta, \tilde{\theta} and D should be: D <- \theta -> \tilde{\theta} (if it is a generative model) or D -> \theta -> \tilde{\theta} (if a discriminative model).",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5300,"Response: We are interested in limiting the mutual information I(\theta, D) between our learned parameters \theta and the dataset D.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
5301,"However, this is hard to calculate for typical deep models.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
5302,"Therefore we introduce a model that forms a Markov chain \theta -> \tilde{\theta} -> D, as shown in Figure 1a.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
5303,"Hereby, \tilde{\theta} is a noisy version of the parameters \theta.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5304,"Crucially, the data D is defined to be dependent only on the noise-corrupted version \tilde{\theta}. By choosing a convenient noise process and prior for \theta we can easily control I(\tilde{\theta}, \theta).",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
5305,"This gives us an upper bound on the mutual information I(D, \theta) between data and parameters, according to the DPI.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2

5312,"Somehow, those connections are not clear to me.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2

5318,1) Technical contributions,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2

5452,"> 3. The model achieved better performances in challenging control tasks compared to previous latent space planning methods, such as PlaNet.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5453,This is an accurate summary.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5454,We would like to highlight two additional points.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5455,"First, the improved performance is attributed to a novel actor-critic algorithm that uses analytic multi-step gradients of predicted state-values (not Q-values).",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
5456,"Second, in addition to outperforming previous latent space planning methods, the proposed algorithm also outperforms the model-free D4PG algorithm, the previous state-of-the-art on this benchmark suite.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5457,> 1.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5458,The work has limited novelty: the learning of the world model (recurrent state-space model) closely follows the prior work of PlaNet.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5459,"In contrast to PlaNet, the difference is that this work learns an actor-critic model in place of online planning with the cross entropy method.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5460,"However, I found the contribution of the actor-critic model is insufficient and requires additional experimental validation (see below).",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5461,Dreamer is a novel algorithm that belongs to the family of actor critic methods.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5462,"At a high level, previous approaches can be grouped into those using Reinforce gradients with V baselines (A3C, PPO, ACER) and those using deterministic or reparameterization gradients of learned Q functions (DDPG, SAC, MVE, STEVE).",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5463,"In comparison, Dreamer uses reparameterization gradients of V functions by backpropagating the value estimates through the latent dynamics.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5464,"Specifically, while Reinforce estimators typically learn V functions, these are only used to reduce the variance of the gradient estimate rather than directly maximizing them with respect to the actor.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5465,Actor-critic algorithms that use analytic gradients of Q critics differ from Dreamer in two ways.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5466,"First, they learn a Q function rather than just a V function.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5467,"Second, the actor only maximizes the Q value predicted for the current time step rather than maximizing multi-step value estimates.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5468,"While MVE and STEVE learn dynamics models (from proprioceptive inputs), the dynamics are not directly used to update the policy.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,1,1
5469,"Instead, they only serve for computing multi-step Q targets for learning the Q critic.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
5470,"Thus, no gradients are backpropagated through the dynamics model for learning the actor or critic.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1

5472,> 2.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5473,"Since the actor-critic model is the novel component in this model (propagating gradients through the learned dynamics), I would like to see additional analysis and baseline comparisons of this method to previous actor-critic policy learning methods, such as DDPG and SAC training on the (fixed) latent state representations, and recent work of MVE or STEVE that use the learned dynamics to accelerate policy learning with multi-step updates.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5474,"As summarized above, Dreamer differs from previous actor-critic algorithms not just by using latent dynamics but also by using analytic multi-step gradients of a V function rather than one-step gradients Q function.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,1,1
5475,"This renders Dreamer conceptually distinct from DDPG, SAC, MVE, and STEVE.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1

5477,"We did not find an improvement over Dreamer (MVE worked worse across tasks) in these experiments, possibly because it only updates the Q function at the initial state of the imagination rollout.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
5478,"Note that with a model, Q values can be computed by combining the dynamics with a value function, so learning Q is not necessary anymore.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
5479,"Since using V in Dreamer outperforms the state-of-the-art D4PG agent and is simpler than the Q function in DDPG and MVE and substantially simpler than STEVE (ensemble of models) and SAC (two Q functions, one V function), we argue for this design choice.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
5480,> 3. [...] It'd be interesting to see how optimization of the actions would lead to better state representations by propagating gradients from the actor-critic model to the world model.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
5481,We have run these experiments and it prevented learning completely.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

5795,"Here delta is the Kronecker delta defined so that \delta_{a,b} = 1 if a = b and 0 if a != b. In the context of the variance of the multivariate normal distribution, the delta function indicates that the different neurons in each layer have zero covariance.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
