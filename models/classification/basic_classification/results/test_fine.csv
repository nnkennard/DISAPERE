227,Summary,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
228,The paper presents a novel approach for learning a generative model where different factors of variations can be independently manipulated.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
229,The method is build upon  the GAN framework where the latent variables are divided into different subsets (chunks) which are expected to encode information about high-level factors of variation.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
230,"To this end, a Siamese Network for each chunk is trained with a contrastive loss minimizing the distance between generated images sharing the same factor (the latent variables in the chunk are equal), and maximizing the distance between pairs where the latent variables differ.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
231,"Given that the proposed model fails in this fully-unsupervised setting, the authors propose to add weak-supervision into the model by forcing the Siamese networks to  focus only on particular aspects of generated images (e.g, color, edges, etc..).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
232,This is achieved by applying  a basic transformation  over the input images in order to remove specific information.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
233,The evaluation of the  proposed model is carried out using the MS-Celeb dataset where the authors provide qualitative results.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

239,"However, the authors do not provide an in-depth discussion of this phenomena.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
240,"Given that previous works [1,2,3] have successfully addressed this problem using a completely unsupervised approach, it would be necessary to give more insights about: (i) why the proposed method is failing (ii) why this negative result is interesting and (iii) if the method could be useful in other potential scenarios.",fine,none,9.0,2,9
241,*The strategy proposed to introduce weak-supervision is too ad-hoc.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
242,I agree that using cues such as the average color of an image can be useful if we want to model basic factors of variation.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
243,"However, it is unclear how a similar strategy could be applied if we are interested in learning variables with higher-level semantics such as the expression of a face or its pose.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
244,"*As far as I understand, the transformations applied to the input images (e.g, edge detection) must be differentiable (given that it is necessary to backpropagate the gradient of the contrastive loss through the generator network).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
245,"If this is the case, this should be properly discussed in the paper.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

411,The authors introduce kaleidoscope matrices (K-matrices) and propose to use them as a substitute for structured matrices arising in ML applications (e.g. circulant matrix used for the convolution operation).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

413,"The authors demonstrate that learnable K-matrices achieve similar metrics compared to hand-crafted features on speech processing and computer vision tasks, can learn from permuted images, achieve performance close to a CNN trained on unpermuted images and demonstrate the improvement of inference speed of a transformer-based architecture for a machine translation task.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

415,The overall quality of the paper is high.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
416,The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a family of matrices called kaleidoscope matrices (or K-matrices) which can be represented as a product of block-diagonal matrices of a special structure.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
417,"Because of the special structure, the family allows near-optimal time matvec operations with near-optimal space complexity for structured matrices which are commonly used in deep architectures.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
418,The proposed approach is novel.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
419,It gives a new characterization of sparse matrices with optimal space complexity up to a logarithmic term.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
420,"Moreover, the proposed characterization is able to learn any structured matrix and matvec time complexity of the K-matrix representation is near-optimal matvec time complexity of the structured matrix.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
421,"Even though in the worst-case complexity is not optimal, the authors argue that for matrices that are commonly used in machine learning architectures (e.g. circulant matrix in a convolution layer) the characterization is optimal.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
422,This results in a new differentiable layer based on a K-matrix that can be trained with the rest of an architecture using standard stochastic gradient methods.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
423,"However, it is worth noting that the reviewer is not an expert in the field, and it is hard for him to compare the proposed approach with previous work.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
424,The paper is generally easy to follow.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
425,"Even though the introduction of K-matrices requires a lot of definitions, they are presented clearly and Figure 1 helps to understand the concept of K-matrices.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
426,The experimental pipeline is also clear.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
427,"Given the special structure of the family, the reviewer might guess that having K-matrices can slow down the training, i.e. it might require more epochs to achieve the reported results compared to baselines.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
428,Providing training plots might increase the quality of the paper.,fine,arg-request_result,4.0,2,4
429,The experimental results are convincing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
430,"First, the authors show that K-matrices can be used instead of a handcrafted MFSC featurization in an LSTM-based architecture on the TIMIT speech recognition benchmark with only a 0.4% loss of phoneme error rate.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
431,"Then, the authors evaluate K-matrices on ImageNet dataset.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
432,"In order to do so, they compare a lightweight ShuffleNet architecture which uses a handcrafted permutation layer to the same architecture but with a learnable K-matrix instead of the permutation layer.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
433,The authors demonstrate the 5% improvement of accuracy over the ShuffleNet with 0.46M parameters with only 0.05M additional parameters of the K-matrix and the 1.2% improvement of accuracy over the ShuffleNet with 2.5M parameters with only 0.2M additional parameters of the K-matrix.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
434,"Next, the authors show that K-matrices can be used to train permutations in image classification domains.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
435,"In order to demonstrate so, they take the Permuted CIFAR-10 dataset and ResNet-18 architecture, insert a trainable K-matrix at the beginning of the architecture and compare against ResNet-18 with an inserted FC-layer (attempting to learn the permutation as well) and ResNet-18 trained on the original, unpermuted CIFAR-10 dataset.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
436,"With K-matrix, the authors achieve a 7.9% accuracy improvement over FC+ResNet-18 and only a 2.4% accuracy drop compared to ResNet-18 trained on the original CIFAR-10.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
437,"Finally, the authors demonstrate that K-matrices can be used instead of the decoder’s linear layers in a Transformer-based architecture on the IWSLT-14 German-English translation benchmark which allows obtaining 30% speedup of the inference using a model with 25% fewer parameters with 1.0 drop of BLEU score.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
438,"Overall, the analysis and the empirical evaluations suggest that K-matrices can be a practical tool in modern deep architectures with a variety of potential benefits and tradeoffs between a number of parameters, inference speed and accuracy, and ability to learn complex structures (e.g. permutations).",fine,none,9.0,8,9

442,The paper proposes a method to disentangle latent variables for certain factors of interest in an image by considering the original input image and a transformation of the image where information about the factors of interest is removed.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

444,"This inductive bias naturally enforces that the second latent variable will not model the information which the first needs to reconstruct the transformed image, due to the VAE objective penalizing redundancy in information present in the latents.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8

745,In addition the authors also propose an original MC sampling strategy which generalize outcome and external sampling strategies.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
746,The paper is interesting and easy to read. My main concern is about the feasibility of using a neural networks to learn cumulative quantities.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
747,The problem of learning cumulative quantities in a neural net is that we need two types of samples:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,8,6
748,"- the positive examples: samples from which we train our network to predict its own value plus the new quantity,",fine,none,9.0,9,9
749,but also:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
750,"- the negative examples: samples from which we should train the network to predict 0, or any desired initial value.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
751,"However in the approach proposed here, the negative examples are missing.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
752,So the network is not trained to predict 0 (or any initial values) for a newly encountered state.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
753,"And since neural networks generalize (very well...) to states that have not been sampled yet, the network would predict an arbitrary values in states that are visited for the first time.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
754,"For example the network predicting the cumulative regret may generalize to large values at newly visited states, instead of predicting a value close to 0.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
755,"The resulting policy can be arbitrarily different from an exploratory (close to uniform) policy, which would be required to minimize regret from a newly visited state.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
756,"Then, even if that state is visited frequently in the future, this error in prediction will never be corrected because the target cumulative regret depends on the previous prediction.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
757,So there is no guarantee this algorithm will minimise the overall regret.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
758,"This is a well known problem for exploration (regret minimization) in reinforcement learning as well (see e.g. the work on pseudo-counts [Bellemare et al., 2016, Unifying Count-Based Exploration and Intrinsic Motivation] as one possible approach based on learning a density model).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
759,"Here, maybe a way to alleviate this problem would be to generate negative samples (where the network would be trained to predict low cumulative values) by following a different (possibly more exploratory) policy.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
760,Other comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
761,- It does not seem necessary to predict cumulative mixture policies (ASN network).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
762,One could train a mixture policy network to directly predict the current policy along trajectories generated by MC.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
763,"Since the samples would be generated according to the current policy \sigma_t, any information nodes I_i would be sampled proportionally to \pi^{\sigma^t}_i(I_i), which is the same probability as in the definition of the mixture policy (4).",fine,none,9.0,9,9

784,Significance of the innovation:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
785,"- The proposed exploration method seemed to be applicable with a particular RL setting: the environment changes could be represented through consecutive frames (e.g., video games), and optical flow could be used to interpret any object displacements in such consecutive frames.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
786,"And as the authors discussed, even under such constraints the applicability of proposed method depends on how much changes of the environment were relevant to the goal.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

789,Summary,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,6,8
790,"A good paper overall, but the experiments were relatively weak (common for most ICLR submissions) and the novelty was somewhat limited.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
791,The submission proposes a new method for agent design to learn about the behaviour of other fixed agents inhabiting the same environment.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
792,The method builds on imitation learning (behavioural cloning) to model the agent’s behaviour and reinforcement learning to learn a probing policy to more broadly explore different target agent behaviours.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
793,"Overall, the approach falls into the field of intrinsic motivation / curiosity-like reward generation procedures but with respect to target agent behaviour instead of the agent’s environment.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
794,"While learning to model the target agent’s inner state, the RL reward is generated based on the difference of the target agent’s inner state between consecutive time steps.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
795,The approach is evaluated against a small set of baselines in various toy grid-world scenarios and a sorting task and overall performs commensurate or better than the investigated baselines.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
796,"Given its limitation to small and low-dimensional environments, it cannot be said how well the approach will scale with respect to these factors and the resulting, more complex agent behaviours.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
797,It would be highly beneficial to evaluate these aspects.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2

806,"By using these networks within a CFR framework, the authors manage to avoid huge memory requirements traditionally needed to save cumulative regret and average strategy values for all information sets across many iterations.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

809,"I did not find many flaws to point out, except I believe the paper could benefit from more extensive  comparisons in Figure 4A against other IIG methods such as Deep Stack, as well as comparing on much larger IIG settings with many more states to see how the neural CFR methods hold up in the regime where they are most needed.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2

817,"- In Table 2, it is not clear to me what is the point for comparing errors of the natural images (which measures the misclassification rate of a natural image) and that of the adversarial images (which measures successful attacks rate), and why this comparison helps to support the claim that the attack results in a stronger certificates.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
818,"In my opinion, to support the above claim, shouldn’t the authors provide a similar table as Table 1, directly comparing the certified radii of the natural images and adversarial images?",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2

889,Each worker has its own set of skills and preferences and the manager tries to assign sub-tasks to these agents along with bonuses such that the agents can even perform tasks that are not preferred by them.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
890,Authors achieve this by training a manager which tracks the skills and preferences of the agents on the fly.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
891,Authors have done an extensive analysis of the proposed approach in two simple domains: resource collection and crafting.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
892,Major comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
893,This paper focuses on multi-agent settings with self-interested agents.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
894,The problem formulation and the solution are novel enough.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
895,Experiments are on toy domains with very few goals and sub-task dependencies.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
896,"However, authors have done a good job in doing an extensive analysis of the proposed approach.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
897,1.	Can you comment about the scalability of the proposed solution when the number of possible subtasks increases? When the sub-task dependency graph size increases?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
898,2.	What is the reason for using rule-based agents in all the experiments? It would have been more useful if all the analysis are done with RL agents rather than rule-based agents.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
899,It would also make the paper stronger.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
900,3.	Are the authors willing to release the code? Overall the model looks complicated and the appendix is not sufficient to reproduce the results in the paper.,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
901,I would increase my rating if the authors are willing to release the code to reproduce all the results reported in the paper.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1

908,The authors proposed an AutoLoss controller that can learn to take actions of updating different parameters and using different loss functions.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
909,Pros,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
910,1. Propose a unified framework for different loss objectives and parameters.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
911,2. An interesting idea in meta learning for learning loss objectives/schedule.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
912,Cons:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
913,"1. The formulation uses REINFORCE, which is often known with high variance.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
914,Are the results averaged across different runs? Can you show the variance?,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,3,1
915,It is hard to understand the results without discussing it.,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,9,0
916,The sample complexity should be also higher than traditional approaches.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
917,2. It is hard to understand what the model has learned compared to hand-crafted schedule. Are there any analysis other than the results alone?,fine,arg-request_result,4.0,3,4
918,3. Why do you set S=1 in the experiments? What’s the importance of S?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
919,4. I think it is quite surprising the AutoLoss can resolve mode collapse in GANs.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
920,I think more analysis is needed to support this claim.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3
921,"5. The evaluation metric of multi-task MT is quite weird. Normally people report BLEU, whereas the authors use PPL.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
922,"6. According to https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainer-gan-lib, I think the bested reported DCGAN results is not 6.16 on CIFAR-10 and people still found other tricks such as spectral-norm is needed to prevent mode-collapse.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
923,Minor:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
924,1. The usage of footnote 2 is incorrect.,fine,arg-request_typo,5.0,9,5
925,"2. In references, some words should be capitalized properly such as gan->GAN.",fine,arg-request_typo,5.0,1,5
926,"Summary: This paper uses visual representation learned over monolingual corpora with image annotations, which overcomes the lack of large-scale bilingual sentence-image pairs for multimodal NMT.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
927,Their approach enables visual information to be integrated into large-scale text-only NMT.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
928,Experiments on four widely used translation datasets show that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over strong baselines.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
929,Strengths:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
930,- This paper is well motivated and well written. I especially like how they use external paired sentence-image data from Multi30k to learn weak pairs for sentences in machine translation.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
931,- Experimental results are convincing. I like how low-resource translation is included as a priority in their experiments.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
932,Weaknesses:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
933,"- Do you have any explanations as to why the number of images, if too large, actually hurts translation performance? Is it because more images also leads to a higher chance of noisy images?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
934,- It would be nice to have an experiment that varies the size of the external paired sentence-image dataset and tested the impact on performance.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
935,- Please comment on the extra computation required for obtaining image data for MT sentences and for learning image representations.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
936,- Why are there missing BLEU scores and the number of parameters in Table 1?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
937,### Post rebuttal,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
938,#,fine,none,9.0,9,9
939,##,fine,none,9.0,9,9
940,Thank you for your detailed answers to my questions.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
941,"The paper is well written and the main contribution, a methodology to find “blind-spot attacks” well motivated and differences to prior work stated clearly.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
942,The empirical results presented in Figure 1 and 2 are very convincing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
943,"The gain of using a sufficiently more complicated approach to assess the overall distance between the test and training dataset is not clear, comparing it to the very insightful histograms.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
944,"Why for example not using a simple score based on the histogram, or even the mean distance?",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
945,Of course providing a single measure would allow to leverage that information during training.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
946,"However, in its current form this seems rather complicated and computationally expensive (KL-based).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
947,As stated later in the paper the histograms themselves are not informative enough to detect such blind-spot transformation.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
948,Intuitively this makes a lot of sense given that the distance is based on the network embedding and is therefore also susceptible to this kind of data.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
949,"However, it is not further discussed how the overall KL-based data similarity measure would help in this case since it seems likely that it would also exhibit the same issue.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
950,"The paper considers an actor-critic scheme for multiagent RL, where the critic is specific to each agent and has access to all other agents' embedded observations.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
951,The main idea is to use an attention mechanism in the critic that learns to selectively scale the contributions of the other agents.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
952,"The paper presents sufficient motivation and background, and the proposed algorithmic implementation seems reasonable.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
953,"The proposed scheme is compared to two recent algorithms for centralized training of decentralized policies, and shows comparable or better results on two synthetic multiagent problems.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
954,I believe that the idea and approach of the paper are interesting and contribute to the multiagent learning literature.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
955,Regarding cons:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
956,"- The critical structural choices (such as the attention model in section 3.2) are presented without too much justification, discussion of alternatives, etc.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
957,"- The experiments show the learning results, but do not provide a peak ""under the hood"" to understand the way attention evolved and contributed to the results.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
958,"- The experiments show good results compared to existing algorithms, but not impressively so.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
959,"This paper suggests a quantization approach for neural networks, based on the Product Quantization (PQ) algorithm which has been successful in quantization for similarity search.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,8,6
960,"The basic idea is to quantize the weights of a neuron/single layer with a variant of PQ, which is modified to optimize the quantization error of inner products of sample inputs with the weights, rather than the weights themselves.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,8,6
961,This is cast as a weighted variant of k-means.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,8,6
962,"The inner product is more directly related to the network output (though still does not account for non-linear neuron activations) and thus is expected to yield better downstream performance, and only requires introducing unlabeled input samples into the quantization process.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
963,This approach is built into a pipeline that gradually quantizes the entire network.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,8,6
964,"Overall, I support the paper and recommend acceptance.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
965,"PQ is known to be successful for quantization in other contexts, and the specialization suggested here for neural networks is natural and well-motivated.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
966,"The method can be expected to perform well empirically, which the experiments verify, and to have potential impact.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
967,Questions:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
968,1. Can you comment on the quantization time of the suggested method? Repeatedly solving the EM steps can add up to quite an overhead.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3
969,Does it pose a difficulty? How does it compare to other methods?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
970,"2. Can you elaborate on the issue of non-linearity? It is mentioned only briefly in the conclusion. What is the difficulty in incorporating it? Is it in solving equation (4)? And perhaps, how do you expect it to effect the results?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
971,"This paper combines the global and local stability prediction and tries to get interpretable results using the stethoscope design, which is actually a weighted subbranch for the main branch.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
972,There are several concerns regarding the proposed framework.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
973,1) How to choose \lambda?,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
974,A better design could be a learnable \lambda.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
975,"Instead of just one scalar value, it could be better to learn a map of \lambdas, which indicates the distribution of local stability and how it is related to global stability.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
976,The visualization of the \lambda map might be more interpretable for understanding the stability prediction.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
977,"2) The global stability prediction does not have a consistent correlation with the local stability prediction, as shown by the easy and hard examples.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
978,This complex relationship will confuse the network during the training.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
979,"That is, the current design hasn't well considered the local and global stability relation, but just simply sum them up.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
980,This is hard to provide a meaningful interpretation of the task.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
981,This paper provides an approach to use visual information to improve text only neural machine translation systems.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
982,"The approach creates a ""topic word to images"" map using an existing image aligned translation corpora.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
983,"Given a source sentence, the model extracts relevant images, extracts their Resnet features and fuses them with the features generated from the word sequence.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
984,The decoder uses these fused representation to generate the target sentence.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
985,"Overall, I like the approach, seems like it can be easily augmented to existing NMT systems.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
986,One of the claims of the paper was to be able to use monolingual image aligned data.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
987,However image captioning datasets are not mentioned.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
988,It would make sense to use image captioning data to create the image lookup.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
989,"Also, what will be the performance of a standard image captioning system on the task ?",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
990,"I believe it will not be great, but I think for completeness, you should add such a baseline.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,1,2
991,Minor comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
992,1. What is M in Algorithm 1 ?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
993,"2. First paragraph in related work is very unrelated to the current subject, please remove.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
994,"Gradient-free evolutionary search methods for Reinforcement Learning are typically very stable, but scale poorly with the number of parameters when optimizing highly-parametrized policies (e.g. neural networks).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
995,"Meanwhile, gradient-based deep RL methods, such as DDPG are often sample efficient, particularly in the off-policy setting when, unlike evolutionary search methods, they can continue to use previous experience to estimate values.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
996,"However, these approaches can also be unstable.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
997,This work combines the well-known CEM search with TD3 (an improved variant of DDPG).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
998,"The key idea of of this work is in each generation of CEM, 1/2 the individuals are improved using TD3 (i.e. the RL gradient).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
999,This method is made more practical by using a replay buffer so experience from previous generations is used for the TD3 updates and importance sampling is used to improve the efficiency of CEM.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1000,"This work shows, on some simple control tasks, that this method appears to result in much stronger performance compared with CEM, and small improvements over TD3 alone.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1001,It also typically out-performs ERL.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1002,"Intuitively, it seems like it may be possible to construct counter-examples where the gradient updates will prevent convergence.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1003,Issues of convergence seem like they deserve some discussion here and potentially could be examined empirically (is CEM-TD3 converging in the swimmer?).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1004,"The justification that the method of Khadka & Tumer (2018) cannot be extended to use CEM, since the RL policies do not comply with the covariance matrix is unclear to me.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1005,"Algorithm 1, step 20, the covariance matrix is updated after the RL step so regardless of how the RL policies are generated, the search distribution on the next distribution includes them.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1006,"In both this work, and Khadka & Tumer, the RL updates lead to policies that differ from the search distribution (indeed that is the point), and there is no guarantee in this work that the TD3 updates result in policies close to the starting point.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1007,"It sees like the more important distinction is that, in this approach, the information flows both from ES to RL and vice-versa, rather than just from RL to ES.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1008,"One view of this method would be that it is an ensemble method for learning the policy [e.g. similar to Osband et al., 2016 for DQN].",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1009,"This could be discussed and a relevant control would be to keep a population (ensemble) of policies, but only update using RL while sharing experience across all actors.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1010,This would isolate the ensemble effect from the evolutionary search.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
1011,Minor issues:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1012,- The ReLU non-linearity in DDPG and TD3 prior work is replaced with tanh.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1013,"This change is noted, but it would be useful to make a least a brief (i.e. one sentence) comment on the motivation for this change.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
1014,- The paper is over the hard page limit for ICLR so needs to be edit to reduce the length.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,1,1
1015,"Osband I, Blundell C, Pritzel A, Van Roy B. Deep exploration via bootstrapped DQN. InAdvances in neural information processing systems 2016 (pp. 4026-4034).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1016,Summary:,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,6,8
1017,This paper looks at the MARL problem in high-dimensional continuous control settings.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
1018,"To improve learning in this multi-agent setting, they propose to pre-train a lower-level policy that takes as input foot-step goals and is executed for a fixed number of timestep, thereby simplifying both the learning and exploration.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1019,I'm a bit unsure of how to evaluate this paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1020,"On the one hand, I believe it has several contributions:",fine,none,9.0,6,9
1021,- Proposing a new MARL - continuous control environment,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1022,"- Proposing a new lower-level policy for high-demensional continuous control environments, including how to learn it",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1023,- Using it to perform MARL in this environment,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1024,"On the other hand, it is hard to say what the _main_ contribution is, which in turn makes it difficult to evaluate whether the experimental evaluation is sufficient:",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1025,"Clearly, a main part of the paper is the work done to construct the hierarchical setup, including goal space, observation space and reward functions.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1026,"However, this work, as far as I can tell, is separate from the MARL problem.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1027,"Furthermore, there are several similar ideas already published, so comparison against those (for example by J. Peng, N. Heess or J. Mere) either as argument or even better as experiment, would be helpful to evaluate the quality of the proposed hierarchy.",fine,none,9.0,2,9
1028,"On the other hand, there is the application of the hierarchical setup to the MARL problem.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1029,"However, as far as I can tell, there is no difference between applying such a hierarchy to the MARL case and to the single agent problem.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1030,"Especially if the lower-level component of the hierarchy is pre-trained in a non-MARL setup, it can just be seen as part of the environment from the point of view of the MARL training, offerring limited new insight into MARL.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1031,"I believe in the second paragraph of 4.1 the authors provide some insight into this matter, however, I have to admit I do not understand this paragraph:",fine,none,9.0,6,9
1032,- Why does temporal correlation reduce the non-stationarity of the MARL problem?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1033,- Why does structured exploration reduce the number of network parameters that need to be learned?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1034,- Why does partial parameter sharing make it easier for each agent to estimate other agents potential changes in behavior?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1035,"In summary, I think this is interesting work, but a clearer explanation of the relationship between HRL and MARL, as well as a clearer main argument, supported by experimental evidence, would greatly improve this paper.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
1036,Edit:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1037,Thank you for your response.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1038,"Unfortunately, I don't feel like it sufficiently addresses my questions and concerns.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1039,"I do apologize if my original comment wasn't clear regarding the contribution part of the paper. What I was trying to say is not that I didn't see the individual contributions of the paper, but instead that the paper does multiple things simultaneously, without comparing against the relevant baselines for any of the individual contributions.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1040,Regarding my questions: I understand where the temporal correlation is coming from in an HRL setting.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1041,"However, what was not clear to me is how this reduces the non-stationarity of MARL.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1042,"I also understand that HRL can reduce the number of parameters, but I don't see how structured exploration reduces the number of parameters.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1043,"And lastly, I also can see how parameter sharing can simplify the learning, but I still don't see how it would allow agents to estimate the behaviour change of other agents easier.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1044,"I feel like in the paragraph in questions, a lot of causes and effects are mixed up and more careful descriptions of the benefits of the algorithm would help.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1045,"I want to re-iterate that I think that the submitted work by the authors is impressive and can provide valuable insights, but I believe it requires more work and more relevant baselines.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1046,"The authors extend an existing approach to adaptive softmax classifiers used for the output component of neural language models into the input component, once again allowing tying between the embedding and softmax.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1047,"This fills a significant gap in the language modeling architecture space, and the perplexity results bear out the advantages of combining adaptively-sized representations with weight tying.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1048,"While the advance is in some sense fairly incremental, the centrality of unsupervised language modeling to modern deep NLP (ELMo, BERT, etc.) implies that perplexity improvements as large as this one may have meaningful downstream effects on performance on other tasks.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1049,Some things I noticed:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1050,"- One comparison that I believe is missing (I could be misreading the tables) is comparing directly to Merity et al.'s approach (adaptive softmax but fixed embedding/softmax dimension among the bands). Presumably you're faster, but is there a perplexity trade-off?",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
1051,- The discussion/explanation of the differing performance of tying or not tying each part of the embedding weights for the different datasets is confusing; I think it could benefit from tightening up the wording but mostly I just had to read it a couple times. Perhaps all that's complicated is the distinction between embedding and projection weights; it would definitely be helpful to be as explicit about that as possible upfront.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,9,1
1052,- The loss by frequency-bin plots are really fantastic.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1053,You could also try a scatterplot of log freq vs. average loss by individual word/BPE token.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1054,- Do you have thoughts as to why full-softmax BPE is worse than adaptive softmax word level?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1055,That goes against the current (industry) conventional wisdom in machine translation and large-scale language modeling that BPE is solidly better than word-level approaches because it tackles the softmax bottleneck while also sharing morphological information between words.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1056,"I vote to reject the paper at this stage, mainly because of the following three points:",fine,none,9.0,6,9
1057,1) The motivation is unclear and overall structure of the paper is confusing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1058,"It should be better motivated why one should use the duality gap as an upper bound for the ""F-distance"".",fine,none,9.0,2,9
1059,Minimizing the F-distance as is usually done seems like the more direct and simple approach.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1060,"Since the results are far from state of the art, a clean and neat presentation of the theoretical advantages and contributions is crucial.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1061,"2) The presentation is not professional, hard to follow and the submission overall looks very rushed:",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1062,"- In equations, please use \inf, \sup, and \text{...} for text such as distance, data, ...",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,1,1
1063,- I have trouble understanding the overall idea behind Algorithm 1 and Eq. (22).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1064,What is the definition of f^* and g^* in Eq. (22)? Some explanatory text would be valuable.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3
1065,"- The set F in Definition 3.5 looks odd, as it appears to be recursive and might not be unique.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1066,"- The writing looks very rushed, and should be improved.",fine,none,9.0,1,9
1067,"For example, I have trouble understanding the sentence ""So the existed algorithms should be heuristic or it can get a bad result even we train the neural networks with lots of datasets."" in the introduction.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
1068,- The aspect ratio in Fig. 5 should be fixed.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,1,1
1069,3) The experiments are completely preliminary and not reasonable:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
1070,"- The WGAN-GP baseline is very weak, i.e. does not show any reasonable generated images (Fig. 9).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1071,There are countless open pytorch implementations on GitHub which out-of-the-box produce much better results.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1072,- The shown inception scores are far from state-of-the-art.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

1471,Figure 1 is crucial to the algorithm design as it aims to prove that Loss-Preserving Linearization (LPL) preserves information on loss function.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1472,"While the authors provided numerical plots to compare it with the SGD linearization, I personally prefer to see some analytically comparsion between SGD linearization and LPL even on the simplest case.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
1473,An appendix with more numerical comparisons on other loss functions might also be insightful.,fine,none,9.0,2,9
1474,2. It seems LPL is mainly compared to SGD for convergence (e.g. Fig 2).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1475,In Table 2 I saw some optimizers end up with much lower test accuracy.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1476,Can the authors show the convergence plots of these methods (similar to Figure 2)?,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1477,"This paper investigates an SGD variant (PowerSGD) where the stochastic gradient is raised to a power of $\gamma \in [0,1]$.  The authors introduce PowerSGD and PowerSGD with momentum (PowerSGDM).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1478,The theoretical proof of  the convergence is given and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than some of the existing popular adaptive SGD techniques.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1479,"Intuitively, the proposed PowerSGD can boost the gradient (since $\gamma \in [0,1]$) so it may be helpful for the gradient of the lower layers of a deep network which may be hit by the vanishing gradient issue.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1480,This may give rise to a faster convergence.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1481,So overall the idea makes sense but I have the following concerns.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1482,1.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
1483,The major issue I have with this paper is Theorem 3.1 on the ergodic convergence rate of the proposed PowerSGD.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1484,"At the first glance, it is $O(\frac{1}{T})$ which is faster than the conventional SGD convergence rate $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$.  But after a closer look, this rate is obtained by a very strong assumption on the batch size $B_{t}=T$.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1485,"In other words, when the number of iterations is large, the batch size will be large too.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1486,I consider this assumption unrealistic.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1487,"Given that $T$ is typically very large (it is iterations, not epochs),  it will require a huge batch size, probably close to the whole training set.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1488,"In this case, it is basically a GD, not SGD any more.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1489,"That's why the rate is $O(\frac{1}{T})$, which is the convergence rate of GD.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1490,I would like to see a convergence proof where the batch size $B_{t}$ is treated as a small constant like other SGD proofs assume.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1491,Actually in the experiments the authors never use an increasing batch size.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1492,"Instead, a constant batch size 128 is used.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1493,"Therefore,  the faster convergence demonstrated in the experiments can not be explained by Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 3.2.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1494,2. There are numerous inaccuracies in the proof given the supplementary material.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1495,"For instance, in Eq.7,",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6

1650,Strengths / Things I liked:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
1651,+ I really liked the motivating problem of being able to (hopefully cheaply / efficiently) estimate transfer potential to understand how well representations will perform on a different task.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1652,+ Multiple representations and tasks experimented with,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1653,Weaknesses / Things that concerned me:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
1654,(In no specific order),fine,none,9.0,9,9
1655,- (W1) Adversely affected by rotations: One of my big concerns with the work is the way the CFS is computed.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1656,"While it seems ok to estimate these different metrics using only linear models, my concern with this is that the linear models are only given a subset of the **exact** dimensions of the original representations.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1657,This is very much unlike the learning objectives of most of these representation learning methods and hence is highly biased and dependent on the actual methods and the random seeds used and the rotations it performs. (In many cases the representations are used starting with a fully connected layer bottom layer on top of the representations and hence rotations of the representations do not affect performance),fine,none,9.0,9,9
1658,Let's take an example: Say there is a single dimension of the representation that is a perfect predictor of a task.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1659,Suppose we rotated these representations. Now the signal from the original dimension is split across multiple dimensions and hence the CFS may be deceivingly high.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1660,To me this is a big concern as different runs of the same representation technique can likely have very different CFS scores based on initializations and random seeds.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1661,- (W2) Related to the last line: I did not see any experiments / analysis showing how stable these different numbers are across different runs of the representation technique. Nor did I see any error bars in the experiments.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1662,This again greatly concerned me as I am not certain how stable these metrics are.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1663,- (W3) Baselines for transfer learning: I felt this was another notable oversight.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1664,"I would have liked to see results for both trivial baselines like random ranking as well as more informed baselines where we can estimate transfer potential using say k representation techniques, and then use that to help us understand how well it would do on the other representations.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1665,This latter baseline is a zero-cost baseline as it is not even dependent on the method.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1666,"- (W4) Metrics for ranking of transfer don't make sense (and some are missing) : I also don't understand how ""precision"" and NDCG are used as metrics.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1667,"Based on my understanding the authors rank (which itself is questionable) the different tasks in order of potential for transfer and then call this the ""gold"" set. How is precision and NDCG calculated from this?",fine,none,9.0,3,9
1668,More importantly I don't believe looking at rank alone is sufficient since that completely obscures the actual performance numbers obtained via transfer.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1669,In most cases I would care about how well my model would perform on transfer not just which tasks I should transfer from. I would have wanted to understand something like the correlation of these produced scores with the actual ground truth performance numbers.,fine,none,9.0,2,9
1670,- (W5) Multi-task learning: I did not see any mention or experiments of what can be expected when the representations are themselves trained on multiple tasks.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1671,(This seems like something that could easily be done in the empirical analysis as well and would provide richer empirical signals as well),fine,none,9.0,9,9
1672,- (W6) Motivation for CFS: I still don't fully understand the need to understand the density of the representation (especially in the manner proposed in the paper). Why is this an important problem? Perhaps expanding on this would be helpful,fine,none,9.0,3,9
1673,-,fine,none,9.0,6,9
1674,(W7) Alternatives to CFS / Computational concerns: A big concern I had was the computational expense of the proposed approach. Unfortunately I did not see any discussion about this in the paper or empirically.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1675,"I find this striking because I can easily come up with cheaper alternatives to get at this ""density"".",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1676,For example using LASSO / LARS like methods you can perhaps figure out a good reduced dimension set more efficiently.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1677,If I were to go through the computation of then why not just train a smaller version of that representation technique instead and **directly** see how well it can encode data in k dimensions via that technique / for that task?,fine,none,9.0,3,9
1678,Alternatively why not try using a factorization technique to reduce the rank and then see how well the method does for different ranks?,fine,none,9.0,2,9
1679,-,fine,none,9.0,6,9
1680,(W7b) Likewise I wonder if we could just measure transfer more directly as well and why we need to go via these CFS sets,fine,none,9.0,2,9
1681,- (W8),fine,none,9.0,9,9
1682,The proposed  CLF weight difference method has some concerning aspects as well.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1683,For example say we had two task with exact opposite labels.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1684,They would have a very low weight difference score though they are ideal representations for each other.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1685,Likewise looking at a difference of weight vectors seems arbitrary in other ways as well.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1686,This paper puts forth adversarial architectures for TTS.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1687,"Currently, there aren't many examples (e.g. Donahue et al,  Engel et al. referenced in paper) of GANs being used successfully in TTS, so this papers in this area are significant.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

1691,I found the discriminator design very interesting.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1692,"As the comment below notes, it is a sort of patch GAN discriminator (See pix2pix, and this comment from Philip Isola - https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/issues/39) and that is could be quite significant in that it classifies at different scales.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1693,"In the image world, having a single discriminator for the whole model would not take into account local structure of the images.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1694,"Likewise, perhaps we can imagine something similar in the case of audio at varying scales - in fact, audio dependencies are even more long range.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1695,That might be one reason why the variable window sizes work here.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1696,"The paper also presents to image analogues for metrics based on FID and the KID, with the features being taken from DeepSpeech2.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1697,I found the speech sample presented very convincing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1698,"In general, the architectures are also presented quite clearly, so it seems that we might be able to reproduce these experiments in our own practice.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1699,It is also promising that producing good speech could be achieved by a non-autoregressive or attention based architecture.,fine,none,9.0,8,9

1706,- the proposed model has two main advantages: (1) it is very fast to train due to the use of pre-trained BERT representations and (2) it does not depends on any external NLP tool (such as dependency parser),fine,none,9.0,9,9
1707,Cons:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1708,- I think the main source of improvement comes from the BERT representations used as input.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

The authors point out that others have observed that this form of compositionality does not leverage any information on the syntax of the pair (a,b), and the propose using a tensor contraction to model an additional multiplicative interaction between a and b, so they propose finding the word whose embedding is closest to a + b + T*a*b, where T is a tensor, and T*a*b denotes the vector obtained by contracting a and b with T. They test this idea specifically on the use-case where (a,b) is an adjective,noun pair, and show that their form of compositionality outperforms weighted versions of additive compositionality in terms of spearman and pearson correlation with human judgements.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1714,"In their model, the word embeddings are learned separately, then the tensor T is learned by minimizing an objective whose goal is to minimize the error in predicting observed trigram statistics.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

1718,"The main appeal is the idea of using T to model syntactic interactions, and the algorithm for learning T. Given that the main attraction of the paper is the potential for more performant word embeddings, I do not believe the work will have wide appeal to ICLR attendees, because no evidence is provided that the features from the learned tensor, say [a, b, T*a*b], are more useful in downstream applications than [a,b] (one experiment in sentiment analysis is tried in the supplementary material with no compelling difference shown).",fine,none,9.0,9,9

1735,Overall I find the paper interesting and enjoyable.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1736,"However, as I am not an expert in the research area, I can not assess how state of the art the suggested method is.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1737,There are a few other questions that I think would be nice to answer. I will try to describe them below:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
1738,Suppose we have a matric W_{ij} with dimensions NxM where changing i for a given j defines a column.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1739,"By definition, linear operation is defined",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1740,y_i = sum_j W_ij x_j .,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1741,Now say each column of matrix W is quantized into m subvectors.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
1742,We can express W_ij in the following way:,fine,none,9.0,6,9
1743,W_ij = (V^1_ij + V^2_ij + ... V^m_ij)x_j where V^m_ij is zero everywhere except for the rows covering a given quantized vector.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1744,"For example, if W had dimensions of 8x16 and m=4,",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1745,"V^2_{3,j}=0, for all j",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1746,", V^2_{4,j}=non_zero, V^2_{7,j}=non_zero, V^2_{8,j}=0, V^2_{i=4:8,j}=one_of_the_quantized_vectors.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1747,y_i = sum_j W_ij x_j = sum_k sum_j (V^k_ij) x_j =def= sum_k z^k_i where z^k are partial products: z^k_i=0 for i<k*N/m and i>(k+1)N/m,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1748,"Thus, the suggested solution effectively splits the output vector y_i into m sections, defines sparse matrices V^k_{ij} 1<=k<=m, and performs column-wise vector quantization for these matrices separately.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
1749,"Generally, it is not ovious or given that the current method would be able to compress general matrices well, as it implicitly assumes that weight W_{ij} has a high ""correlation"" with weights W_{i+kN/m,j} (which I call ""vertical"" correlation), W_{i,k+some_number} (which I call ""horizontal"" correlation) and W_{i+kN/m,k+some_number} (which I call ""other"" correlation).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1750,It is not given that those kind of redundancies would exist in arbitrary weight matrices.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1751,"Naturally, the method will work well when weight matrices have a lot of structure and then quantized vectors can be reused.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

1753,It would be very interesting to see which kind of redundancy their method managed to caprture.,fine,none,9.0,2,9
1754,"In the 'horizontal' case, it should work well when inputs have a lot of redundancy (say x_j' and x_j'' are highly correlated making it possible to reuse code-words horizontally within any given V^k: V^k_ij'=V^k_ij'').",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1755,"However, if thise was the case, it would make more sense to simply remove redundancy by prunning input vector x_j by removing either x_j' or x_j'' from it.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1756,This can be dome by removing one of the outputs from the previous layer.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,8,2
1757,This can be a symptom of a redundant input.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,8,2
1758,"Another option is exploiting ""vertical"" redundancy: this happens when output y_i' is correlated with output y_{i'+N/m}. This allows the same code-word to be reused vertically.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
1759,This can be a symptom of a redundant output.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,8,2
1760,It could also be the case that compressibility could be further subtantially improved by trying different matrix row permutations.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
1761,"Also, if one notices that y_i' ir correlated with y_i'', it might make sense to permute matrix rows in such a way that both rows would end up a multiple N/m apart.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2

1886,Update to the Review after the rebuttal from the Authors:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1887,After carefully reviewing the responses by the authors especially on my concerns about the significance of solving an instance of a given problem and the improvement in the exposition of the ideas I would like to amend my earlier decision and recommend to accept.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1888,For completeness below is the original review.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,6,7
1889,This paper introduces a framework to learn to generate solutions to online combinatorial optimization problems with worst case guarantees.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1890,"The framework as the authors claim eliminates the need for manual hard to solve instance/data creation, which is necessary to teach the model to provide the aforementioned worst case guarantees.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1891,"Therefore the main contribution of the paper can be said that this framework shows that it is possible to train a machine learning model, which can learn an algorithm to solve hard online combinatorial optimization problems and this training can be done without knowing much about the actual optimization problem domain.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1892,The only input required is the way to calculate the objective function of the actual problem.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
1893,This contribution is demonstrated on two classes of problems: Ski-Rental and Fractional AdWords.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1894,The framework requires two neural networks one for solution generation agent and one for problem instance generation.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1895,These two networks are trained jointly from scratch and the underlying algorithm for the training is provided.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1896,Although a generic framework that learns to solve online combinatorial optimization problems without domain knowledge is by itself a very motivational goal neither the paper successfully demonstrates that the framework the authors propose achieves this goal nor it explains well enough why one would take the machine learning approach to find good algorithms to such problems.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1897,Is it because the ML solution would be faster to compute with big instances? Is it because with the proposed approach one can curate sophisticated heuristic solutions when provable optimality is out of reach?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1898,"This paper should be rejected because proposed method demonstrates that an instance of one class of problems, Fractional Adwords, can be learned to solve without domain expertise, however fails to prove that the approach would be beneficial for any other instances of the same problem.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1899,"Although they show that the Ski Rental problem can also be learned to solve though it is trivial and does not even use the framework the authors propose in its full extent, ie. problem instances are not generated by use of a machine learning model, which is one of main claims the authors are making.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1900,Therefore I do not find being able to solve this problem as a supporting evidence for the contributions claimed.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1901,In particular there is not any theoretical not experimental evidence that the approach would scale to any instances where a pure optimization approach would be slow to provide any meaningful solutions.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1902,I find this important because for combinatorial optimization usually scale matters a lot.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1903,While a small instance of a problem can be solve by a general purpose solver quickly a small increase in the problem size can turn out to be intractable.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1904,When proposing a machine learning approach to such problems I would expect the model to scale better than pure optimization approach so that there would be demonstrable benefit.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1905,Although the paper proposes an interesting framework I would argue that it is a “green apple” in the sense that authors need to motivate the approach better and expand the contribution beyond solving a particular instance.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1906,"Authors acknowledge the fact that their experimental setup is rather limited in Appendix C.1, which I agree with and they also claim that there is a representation for a uniform algorithm for any number of advertisers for the AdWords problem, however they leave this as a future work, which I find unfortunate. I would recommend taking this direction rigorously and expand the contribution, which would prove to be a very sound contribution.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
1907,In order to clarify the exposition the following are some questions:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1908,1. Authors call the approach YaoGAN due to its structural similarity to GANs.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1909,"I understand the fact that they are training two neural networks in an alternating scheme, which is similar to the GAN training.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1910,How can one evaluate the solutions generated by this framework similar to how GAN generators are evaluated?,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
1911,"Can one walk the latent distribution of the algorithm agent and draw insights, which might lead into tailoring some algorithms that would be appropriate for some input distribution although in general inferior in terms of worst case guarantees?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1912,2. The main technical contribution claim needs to be elaborated.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,1,2
1913,I understand how the game theoretic framework is established but how does this manifest itself in the algorithm described in Section 3.1 needs more explanation.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
1914,3. Authors claim there are two shortcomings of the previous method proposed in Kong et. al 2018.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1915,They need to elaborate how their method overcomes these issues better.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1916,"4. Authors state that fractional relaxation of combinatorial mainly integer optimization problems, which is accurate.",fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1917,Yet their approach is only able to solve the fractional version of the AdWords problem.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1918,In addition I agree with the fact that although continuous relaxations to integer optimization problems might provide insightful directions they usually employed to to prove bounds on the heuristic approaches.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1919,"Yet the authors stop at only solving this version with a machine learning approach, which does not hit the bar for me.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1920,I would have expected the authors to at least elaborate on why the current framework is not suitable for the non-relaxed problem.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1921,What are the shortcomings?,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
1922,"5.In Appendix A authors talk about no-regret dynamics, which are relevant.",fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1923,"However, they state they loosely follow this approach. What does that entail? What kind of theoretical guarantees are given up due to not following this, a better exposition on this topic would help to support the claims.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1924,6. In appendix C.2 authors provide additional plots for the Fractional AdWords problem.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1925,"However, they retain from providing any intuition about them.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1926,In particular what is the conclusion to be drawn from Figure 5.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
1927,This needs more elaboration. Is this way of training results expected? What is the lesson learned?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1928,7.In Figure 8 they provide example data from experience array.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1929,What are the significance of these examples? How they help us understand the problem instance generation was actually able to find interesting instances? What kind of dynamics are under covered?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
1930,These are not directly revealed by only looking at the pictures one needs more explanation to support the claims.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1931,This paper proposed a method pGAN based on Generative Adversarial Networks to generate poisoning examples in order to degrade the performance of classifiers when trained on the poisoned training data.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1932,The authors evaluated pGAN on both synthetic datasets and commonly used MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets in machine learning.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
1933,The paper is self-contained and easy to read. My main concern is on the experiment results.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1934,The detailed questions are as follows:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1935,Q1: Has the authors tried more complicated datasets such as CIFAR-10 to evaluate the pGAN method? It would make the paper more convincing to add results on more complex datasets.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
1936,Q2: Can the authors structure the experimental results with different sections? Currently it is just a single section which is difficult to read.,fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,3,1
1937,"Q3: The authors noticed that “But, as we decrease the value of α, the distribution of red points shifts towards the region where both green and blue distributions overlap”.",fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1938,This observation is interesting as it finds that the poisoned input tends to lie on the overlap of two classes.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
1939,But this can easily lead to a defense method: remove those training examples that are close to the other class.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1940,This defense mechanism can be used together with other sanitization approaches.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
1941,So I would like to see how would pGAN perform in this case?,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
1942,Q4: The authors mentioned “Comparison with existing poisoning attacks in the research literature is challenging: Optimal poisoning attacks as in Munoz-Gonzalez et al. (2017) are computationally very expensive for the size of the networks and datasets used in our experiments in Fig. 2.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
1943,”,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1944,.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1945,"However, I can not agree because you can simply generate poisoned data and train the neural networks on the poisoned data regardless of the underlying approach that is targeted in generating the poisoned data.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1946,This would be an effective baseline to compare. (Correct me if I am wrong here.),fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
1947,I will change my score if the authors can address my concerns here.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

2147,The contribution of this paper is incremental due to the following reasons.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
2148,1) The duality gap is only an upper bound of the F-distance.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2149,This means that if the duality gap is zero then the learned distribution is the true distribution.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

2152,The proof of the upper bound is straightforward.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

2627,1. (Also AREA CHAIR NOTE): Another parallel submission to ICLR titled “Generative Ensembles for Robust Anomaly Detection” makes similar observations and seemed to suggest that ensembling can help counter the observed CIFAR/SVHN phenomena unlike what we see in Figure 10.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2628,Their criteria also accounts for the variance in model log-likelihoods and is hence slightly different.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2629,"2. Even though Figure 2b shows that SVHN test likelihoods are higher than CIFAR test likelihoods, the overlap in the histograms of CIFAR-train and CIFAR-test is much higher than the overlap in CIFAR-train and SVHN-test.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2630,"If we define both maximum and minimum thresholds based on the CIFAR-train histogram, it seems like one could detect most SVHN samples just by the virtue that there likelihoods are much higher than even the max threshold determined by the CIFAR-train histogram?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
2631,3. Why does the constant image (all zeros) in Figure 9 (appendix) have such a high likelihood? It’s mean (=0 trivially) is clearly different from the means of the CIFAR-10 images (Figure 6a) so the second order analysis of Section 5 doesn’t seem applicable.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
2632,4. How much of this phenomena do you think is characteristic for images specifically? Would be interesting to test anomaly detection using deep generative models trained on modalities other than images.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2

2928,"With this dataset, it's a bit of a stretch to say there was ""only a 1 point drop in BLEU score"". That's a significant drop, and in fact the DynamicConv paper goes to significant lengths to make a smaller 0.8 point improvement.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

2930,The paper proposes a framework for learning interpretable latent representations for GANs.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2931,The key idea is to use siamese networks with contrastive loss.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2932,"Specifically, it decomposes the latent code to a set of knobs (sub part of the latent code).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2933,Each time it renders different images with different configurations of the knobs.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2934,"For example, 1) as changing one knob while keeping the others, it expects it would only result in change of one attribute in the image, and 2) as keeping one knob while changing all the others, it expects it would result in large change of image appearances.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
2935,The relative magnitude of change for 1) and 2) justifies the use of a Siamese network in addition to the image discriminator in the standard GAN framework.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8

2945,This paper describes a model for musical timbre transfer which builds on recent developments in domain- and style transfer.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2946,"The proposed method is designed to be many-to-many, and uses a single pair of encoders and decoders with additional conditioning inputs to select the source and target domains (timbres).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

2948,"The method is compared against the UNIT model under a variety of training conditions, and evaluated for within-domain reconstruction and transfer accuracy as measured by maximum mean discrepancy.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2949,"The proposed model seems to improve on the transfer accuracy, with a slight hit to reconstruction accuracy.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8

2954,"The empirical comparisons to UNIT are reasonably thorough, though I would have preferred more in-depth evaluation of the MoVE model as well.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2955,"Specifically, the authors introduced an extra input (control) to encode the pitch class and octave information during encoding.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,8,6
2956,"I infer that this was necessary to achieve good performance, but it would be instructive to see the results without this additional input, since it does in a sense constitute a form of supervision, and therefore limits the types of training data which can be used.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
2957,"While I understand that quantifying performance in this application is difficult, I do find the results difficult to interpret.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2958,Some of this comes down to incomplete definition of the metrics (see detailed comments below).,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6

2988,The authors claim that the proposed method outperforms methods that use hand crafted features; also the authors claim that the proposed method has better transferability.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
2989,"My overall concern is that the experiment result doesn’t really fully support the claim in the two aspects: 1) the SASNet takes the enriched dataset as input to the neural net but it also uses the complex (validation set) to train the optimal parameters, so strictly it doesn’t really fit in the “transfer” learning scenario.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2990,"Also, the compared methods don’t really use the validation set from the complex data for training at all.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2991,Thus the experiment comparison is not really fair.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2992,"2) The experiment results include standard errors for different replicates where such replicates correspond to different training random seeds (or different samples from the enriched set?), however, it doesn’t include any significance of the sampling.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

2994,"A more rigorous setting is to, for N runs, each run splitting the validation and testing set differently.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
2995,"Since this paper is an application paper, rather than a theoretical paper that bears theoretical findings, I would expect much more thorough experimental setup and analysis.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2

2998,"Results and discussion about how the previous methods with full features perform compared to SASNet, and also how we can include those features into SASNet should complete the paper.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2

3000,Some minor issues:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6

3002,2)	It is not clear what the “replicates” refer to in the experiments.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3003,3)	Some discussion on why the “SASNet ensemble” would yield better performance would be good; could it be overfitting?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
3004,Problem and contribution:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3005,The paper studies if the Visual Question answering model “FILM” from Perez et al (2018) is able to decide if “most” of the objects have a certain attribute or color.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3006,For this it tries to mimic the setup used to test human abilities in the study by Pietroski et al. (2009).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3007,The main contribution of this is work is a discussion of how a model could solve the problem of deciding “most” and the study which shows that the studied model has some ability to do this.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3008,From this the paper concludes that the model is likely to have some approximate number system.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3009,Strengths:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3010,"1.	The paper looks at a new angle to study and characterize CNN models in general, and VQA models in particular by looking into the psycholinguistic literature experimental setup studied with human subjects.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
3011,"2.	The paper studies different variants of controlling for different factors (e.g. pairing data points, area used, different training data and pre-trained vs. trained from scratch CNN models)",fine,none,9.0,8,9
3012,3.	It is interesting to see that the models performance reasonably aligns with the curve predicted by “Weber’s law”.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3013,Weaknesses:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3014,"4.	Number of objects vs. ratios is not disentangled: While the paper clarifies that not only a smaller number of objects are used, it would be interesting to understand if similar conclusions hold if only the same number or about the same number of total objects are used but the ratios change (at least for more extreme ratios, 1:2, this seems to be the case as they achieve 100% accuracy).",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
3015,5.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
3016,"The paper only focusses on a single VQA model (FILM) which limits the understanding if this observation is specific to this model; what about other models such as the one from Hudson & Manning (2018), or Relation Networks (Santoro et al) or even simpler baselines: A system which two attention mechanisms (without normalizations) which are sum pooled and then compared would sort of explicitly encode the idea of the APN system.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3017,It would be valuable to compare them to see how different systems (can) solve this task.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
3018,I would expect that the architecture favors certain capabilities; e.g. Relation Networks might lead more to a paring-based strategy. Or Zhang et al. (2018) might be able to exploit explicit counting to solve the task.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3019,6.	The “most” ability or APN ability seems to be highly related to accumulation in neural networks.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

3037,The authors show that by adding this loss term they can achieve SOTA (for single softmax model) perplexity on a number of LM benchmarks.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3038,The technical contribution is proposing a new loss term to use when training a language model.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3039,"The idea is clear, simple, and well explained, and it seems to be effective in practice.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3040,One drawback is that it is highly specific to language models.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3041,"Other recent works which have demonstrated effective regularization of LSTM LMs have proposed methods that can be used in any LSTM model, but that is not the case here.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

3082,This work proposes a hybrid VAE-based model (combined with an adversarial or maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based loss) to perform timbre transfer on recordings of musical instruments.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3083,"Contrary to previous work, a single (conditioned) decoder is used for all instrument domains, which means a single model can be used to convert any source domain to any target domain.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

3087,I have several further concerns about this work:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3088,"* The fact that the model makes use of pitch class and octave labels also raises questions about applicability -- if I understood correctly, transfer can only be done when this information is present.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

3121,Summary:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3122,The authors propose a new method called BA-Net to solve the SfM problem by explicitly incorporating geometry priors into a machine learning task.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3123,The authors focus on the Bundle Adjustment process.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3124,"Given several successive frames of a video sequence (2 frames but can be extended up to 5), BA-Net jointly estimates the depth of the first frame and the relative camera motion (between the first frame and the next one).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3125,The method is based on a convolutional neural network which extracts the features of the different pyramid levels of the two images and in parallel computes the depth map of the first frame.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3126,"The proposed network is based on the DRN-54 (Yu et al., 2017) as a feature extractor.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3127,This is complemented by the linear combination of depth bases obtained from the first image.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3128,The features and the initial depth then passed to the optimization layer called BA-layer where the feature re-projection error is minimized by the modified LM algorithm.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3129,The authors adapt the standard multi-view geometry constraints by a new concept of feature re-projection error in the BA framework (BA-layer) which they made differentiable.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3130,Differentiable optimization of camera motion and image depth via LM algorithm is now possible and can be used in various other DL architectures (ex. MVS-Net can probably benefit from BA-layer).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
3131,"The authors also propose a novel depth parametrization in the form of linear combination of depth bases which reduces the number of parameters for the learning task,",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3132,enables integration into the same backbone net as used or feature pyramids and makes it possible to jointly train the depth generator and the BA-layer.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3133,Originally the proposed approach depicts the network operating in the two-view settings.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3134,"The extensibility to more views is also possible and, as shown by authors, proved to improve performance.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
3135,"It is, however, limited by the GPU capacity.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
3136,"Overall, the authors came up with an interesting approach to the standard BA problem.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3137,They have managed to inject the multi-view geometry priors and BA into the DL architecture.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

3180,This paper introduces a new generative poisoning attack method against machine learning classifiers.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3181,The authors propose pGAN with three components to maximum the error of classification and guarantee undistinguished poisoning data for the discriminator.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3182,The experimental results show that the hyperparameter \alpha significantly affects the poisoning data distribution and pGAN leads to specific error in a classification task.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3183,"This paper should be weekly accepted, considering the following aspects.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3184,Positive points: (1) The experiments seem solid.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3185,The overall performance with different parameters and the corresponding error type have been evaluated.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
3186,(2) The error-specific and performance-control characteristics of pGAN seem to be interesting.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3187,(3) The paper is well organized.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3188,Negative points: (1) The authors should provide more justification on equation-3.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,1,3
3189,Why do the authors directly average different loss for the discriminator and the classifer?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
3190,"(2) The function of the discriminator is not very clear, especially for the classification error test.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3191,Does the discriminator exclude the poisoning data according to certain rule?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
3192,It would make more sense if the classification error measured from the data the discriminator selects.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
3193,(3) pGAN can produce error-specific attack without sufficient justifications.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3194,Why can pGAN lead to the inclination? Is it possible for pGAN to control the specific error tendency?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
3195,"(4) For the error-specific attack task, it would be better to provide an ablation experiment.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
3196,"For example, authors could implement pGAN by ignoring the detectability of the discriminator (i.e. \alpha=0) or typical pGAN when they compare with the label-flip operation.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
3197,Please explain which component contribute to the error-specific inclination.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
3198,The paper presents proof that the DeepSets and a variant of PointNet are universal approximators for permutation equivariant functions.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3199,The proof uses an expression for equivariant polynomials and the universality of MLP.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3200,"It then shows that the proposed expression in terms of power-sum polynomials can be constructed in PointNet using a minimal modification to the architecture, or using DeepSets, therefore proving the universality of such deep models.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3201,The results of this paper are important.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3202,"In terms of presentation, the notation and statement of theorems are precise, however, the presentation is rather dry, and I think the paper can be significantly more accessible.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3203,"For example, here is an alternative and clearer route presenting the same result: one may study the simple case of having single input channel, for which the output at index ""i"" of an equivariant polynomial is written as the sum of all powers of input multiplied by a polynomial function of the corresponding power-sum.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3204,"This second part is indeed what is used in the proof of the universality of the permutation invariant version of DeepSets, making the connection more visible.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

3207,"Given the fact that it applies the same MLP independently to individual set members, it is obvious that it is not universal equivariant (for example, consider a function that performs a fixed permutation to its input), and I fail to see why the paper goes into the trouble of having theorems and experiments just to demonstrate this point. If there were any other objectives beyond this in the experiments could you please clarify?",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,9,0

3211,It is shown in the paper neural nets tend to be misled by local stability when the task is to predict global stability.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3212,Then the paper utilizes the proposed framework to de-bias the misleading correlation to achieve a state-of-the-art on the dataset.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

3216,"However, my concern is that the paper focuses only on a very specific application domain,  and an improvement over the niche dataset with much more supervision (from the extension) is not surprising at all. In the mean time, the notion of ""Neural Stethoscopes"" could be much more  generally applied.

3218,The authors look at the problem of exploration in deep RL.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3219,They propose a “curiosity grid” which is a virtual grid laid out on top of the current level/area that an Atari agent is in.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3220,"Once an agent enters a new cell of the grid, it obtains a small reward, encouraging the agent to explore all parts of the game.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3221,The grid is reset (meaning new rewards can be obtained) after every roll out (meaning the Atari agent has used up all its lives and the game restarts).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3222,The authors argue that this method enables better exploration and they obtain an impressive score on Montezuma’s Revenge (MR).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3223,Review:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3224,"The paper contains an extensive introduction with many references to prior work, and a sensible lead up to the introduced algorithm.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3225,The algorithm itself seems to work well and some of the results are convincing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3226,I am a bit worried about the fact that the agents have access to their history of locations (“the grid”).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3227,The authors mention that none of the methods they compare against has this advantage and it seems that in a game that rewards exploration directly (MR) this is a large advantage.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3228,The authors comment on this advantage in section 3 and found that removing intrinsic rewards hurt performance significantly.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
3229,Only removing the grid access made results on MR very unstable.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3230,"However in order to compute the intrinsic rewards, it still seems necessary to access the location of the agent, meaning that implicitly the advantage of the method is still there.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3231,"I was wondering if the authors find that the agents are forcibly exploring the entire environment during each rollout? Even if the agent knows what/where the actual goal is. There is a hint to this behaviour in section 4, on exploration in sparse domains.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
3232,"The future work section mentions some interesting improvements, where the agent position is learned from data. That seems like a promising direction that would generalise beyond Atari games and avoids the advantage.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
