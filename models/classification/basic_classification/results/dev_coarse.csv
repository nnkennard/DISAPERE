2,Existing work [Michelashvili &Wolf] trains generative networks to model signal-to-noise ratio rather than the signal itself.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
3,This paper proposes a new convolutional operator called Harmonic Convolution to improve these generative networks to model both signals or signal-to-noise ratio.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5

6,The explanation in Fig 2 on why this is the case seem to me not so clear. Are you trying to show that the Wave-U-Net does not work since there is no 1/f^2 law for clean audio signals?,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
7,"The Harmonic Convolution is similar to deformable convolutions, but specifically designed to capture audio harmonics.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5

35,Summary: This paper introduces the task of using deep learning for auto-completion in UI design.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
36,"The basic idea is that given a partially completed tree (representing the design state of the UI), the goal is to predict or ""autocomplete"" the final tree.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
37,"The authors propose a transformer-based solution to the task, considering three variants: a vanilla approach where the tree is flattened to a sequence, a pointer-network style approach, and a recursive transformer.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
38,Preliminary experiments indicate that the recursive model performs best and that the task is reasonable difficulty.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5

45,"Moreover, it seems strange that significant space was used to give equations describing simple embedding lookups (i.e., matrix multiplications with one-hot vectors), but the basic technical foundations of Transformers were not adequately explained.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
46,"In addition, only the transformer baselines were considered, and it would seem natural to consider LSTM-based baselines, or some other related techniques.",coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
47,"In general, the space that was used to explain the Transformer baselines---which are essentially straightforward ways to adapt transformers to this task---could have been used to give more detail on the dataset.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,3,0
48,"For example, one question is how often a single partial tree has multiple possible completions in the data.",coarse,arg_request,3.0,1,3
49,"A major issue---mainly due to the lack of technical details and the lack of promise to provide code/data (unless I missed this)---is that the paper does not appear to be reproducible.

71,The paper proposes an approach to provide contrastive visual explanations for deep neural networks -- why the network assigned more confidence to some class A as opposed to some other class B. As opposed to the applicability of previous approaches to this problem -- the approach is designed to directly answer the contrastive explanations question rather adapting other visual saliency techniques for the same.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5

77,Comments:,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
78,- One of the problems highlighted in the paper regarding existing explanation modalities is the use of another black-box to explain the decisions of an existing deep network (also somewhat of a black-box) which the authors claim their model does not suffer from.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,0,5
79,The proposed approach provides explanations by operating in the latent space of a learned generative model of the input distribution.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
80,The learned generator in itself is somewhat of a black-box itself -- there has been prior work indicating how much of the input distribution,coarse,arg_fact,1.0,0,1
81,are GANs able to capture.,coarse,none,6.0,6,6
82,"As such, conditioning on a generative model to propose such contrastive explanations is to some extent using another black-box (generator) to explain the decisions of an existing one.",coarse,arg_fact,1.0,1,1
83,"Thus, the above claim made in the paper does not seem well-founded.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
84,"Furthermore, in experiments, the paper does not provide any quantitatively convincing results to suggest the generator in use is a good one.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
85,- While the authors suggest that a latent model over the input distribution needs to be trained only once and is applicable off-the-shelf for any further contrastive explanations regarding any network operating on the same dataset -- learning such a model of the input space is an overhead in itself.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0

146,This paper proposes the Cramer-Wold autoencoder.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
147,The first contribution of the paper is to propose the Cramer-Wold distance between two distributions based on the Cramer-Wold Theorem.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5

149,The second contribution of the paper is to develop a generative autoencoder which uses the Cramer-Wold distance to match the latent distribution of the data to the prior distribution.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
150,"While I found the derivation of the Cramer-Wold distance interesting, the final form of this distance (Eq. 2), to me, looks very similar to the MMD with a particular kernel.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
151,My main question is that: what is the main advantage of the Cramer-Wold distance to an MMD with a proper kernel?,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3

234,The parameters of the function are then fit using linear regression on observed data.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
235,"The authors show that the regressed function \(\epsilon(m,n)\) is able to predict the generalization error for various \(m\) and \(n\) reasonably accurately.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5

934,2. What effect does the window size for transforming states to observations have on the performance of SECRET?,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
935,"3. On a high-level, how does SECRET compare to transfer through relational deep reinforcement learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01830?

949,"3) Most frequent features, if discriminative, can prevent learning of other, less frequent, features.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,1,5

951,"Even for a shallow net, the authors are essentially assuming that the first layer of weights W is such that each row w is already a hyperplane separating the two classes after initialization (wx > 0 for all x belonging to one class and wx' < 0 for x' in the other class).",coarse,none,6.0,1,6
952,"In other words, at initialization, the first layer is already correctly classifying all data points.",coarse,arg_fact,1.0,1,1

1260,In this work the authors introduce a new method for neural architecture search (NAS) and use it in the context of network compression.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1261,"Specifically, the NAS method is used to select the precision quantization of the weights at each layer of the neural network.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1262,"Briefly, this is done by first defining a super network, which is a DAG where for each pair of nodes, the output node is the linear combination of the outputs of all possible operations (i.e., layers with different precision quantizations).",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1263,"Following [1], the weights of the linear combination are regarded as the probabilities of having certain operations (i.e., precision quantization), which allows for learning a probability distribution over the considered operations.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1264,"Differently from [1], however, the authors bridge the soft sampling in [1] (where all operations are considered together but weighted accordingly to the corresponding probabilities) to a hard sampling (where a single operation is considered with the corresponding probability) through an annealing procedure based on the Gumbel Softmax technique.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1265,"Through the proposed NAS algorithm, one can learn a probability distribution on the operations by minimizing a loss that accounts for both accuracy and model size.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1266,"The final output of this search phase is a set of sampled architectures (containing a single operation at each connection between nodes), which are then retrained from scratch.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5

1274,"Why? If we are learning the distribution, would not it make sense to sample all architectures only after training the supernet at our best?",coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3

1276,"In the CIFAR-10 experiments, the authors sample 5 architecture every 10 epochs, which means 45 architectures (90 epochs were considered).",coarse,arg_fact,1.0,5,1
1277,"This is a lot of architectures, which makes me wonder: how would a “cost-aware” random sampling perform with the same number of sampled architectures?",coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1278,"Also, I have some more questions/minor concerns:",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1279,1)	The authors say that the expectation of the loss function is not directly differentiable with respect to the architecture parameters because of the discrete random variable.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,0,5
1280,"For this reason, they introduce a Gumbel Softmax technique, which makes the mask soft, and thus the loss becomes differentiable with respect to the architecture parameters.",coarse,arg_fact,1.0,5,1
1281,"However, subsequently in the manuscript, they write that Eq 6 provides an unbiased estimate for the gradients.",coarse,arg_fact,1.0,1,1
1282,Do they here refer to the gradients with respect to the weights ONLY?,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1283,Could we say that the advantage of the Gumbel Softmax technique is two-fold? i) make the loss differentiable with respect to the arch parameters; ii) reduce the variance of the estimate of the loss gradients with respect to the network weights.,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1284,"2)	Can the author discuss why the soft sampling procedure in [1] is not enough? I have an intuitive understanding of this, but I think this should be clearly discussed in the manuscript as this is a central aspect of the paper.",coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1285,3)	The authors use a certain number of warmup steps to train the network weights without updating the architecture parameters to ensure that “the weights are sufficiently trained”. Can the authors discuss the choice on the number of warmup epochs?,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3

1441,"2) The classification error, with respect to the number of iterations of gradient descent, exhibits a sigmoidal shape.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,0,5
1442,"However, there are two strong assumptions: 1. the two data are perfectly separable by linear classifier.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,0,5
1443,"2.  H2 assumes ""at the beginning of training data points from different classes do not activate the same neurons"".",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,1,5
1444,"This is a very strong initial assumption, I am not sure how likely this assumption would be satisfied.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1445,It sounds to me this assumption implicitly suggests that the algorithm is already ALMOST CONVERGENT.,coarse,arg_fact,1.0,1,1
1446,"If this assumption cannot be weakened, I don't think the paper can be accepted.",coarse,arg_social,4.0,0,4
1447,The underlying motivation for the paper is really interesting and cuts straight to the heart of Deep Learning and strives to unravel the key understanding that we are still to a large extent missing.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1448,"When it comes to clarity and organization I find the paper a bit ""messy"" in that it is a collection of quite a few findings on the very specific topic of binary classification with quite strong assumptions.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1449,Especially given the very specific nature of the topic I miss a strong and clear path through the paper.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1450,Unfortunately the paper leaves me with the distinct feeling that there are still a lot of work needed to be able to tell the story about the problem under study.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1451,Having said that the paper does contain several individual findings.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1452,"Having said that I find the ideas leading up to what the authors refers to as ""gradient starvation"" to be really interesting and that would be a great clear idea to focus on.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1453,A few concrete questions/comments:,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1454,"Can you explain somewhere exactly what you mean when you say ""learning dynamics of deep learning""? Given the specific nature of the results presented in the paper it would be nice to be precise also when it comes to the overall topic under study.",coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1455,Given the very specific nature of the topic treated in the paper I find the title of the paper largely misleading.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1456,"The title claims way more than what is actually delivered in the paper, despite the fact that the authors have put in an ""On"" in the beginning of the title.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1457,"In Corollary 3.3. you characterize the convergence speed in a nice way, but I am missing the link to the behaviors observed empirically in e.g. Fig. 2. What am I missing?",coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1458,The final sentence in Section 2 is highly speculative and I find this hard to believe without solid backing.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1459,"The sentence reads ""... and helps develop intuitions about behaviors observed in more general settings."" Given the restrictive nature of your set-up I find it very hard to believe that this extends to more general settings.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1460,"Tiny detail: The axes of several of the plots given in the paper mis the lables which makes it hard to read. Straightforward to fix, but worth mentioning nevertheless.",coarse,arg_request,3.0,0,3
1461,"The paper proposes learning Restricted Boltzmann Machines for solving small computational tasks (e.g., 1-bit addition) and composing those RBMs to form a more complex computational module (e.g., 16-bit addition).",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1462,The claim is that such an approach can be more data efficient than learning a single network to directly learn the more complex module.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1463,Results are shown for addition and factoring tasks.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1464,- The paper is somewhat easy to follow and the figures are helpful. But the overall organization and flow of ideas can be improved significantly.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1465,"- The term ""combinatorial optimization"" is used in a confusing way -- addition would not usually be called a combinatorial optimization problem.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1466,- It would be good to understand what benefit does the stochasticity of RBMs provide.,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1467,How do deterministic neural networks perform on the addition and factoring tasks?,coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1468,"The choice of RBMs is not motivated well and without any comparisons to alternatives, it comes across",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1469,as arbitrary.,coarse,none,6.0,6,6
1470,- That learning simple functions and composing them to compute more complex functions would be more data efficient than directly learning the complex functions does not seem very surprising.,coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1471,"After all, the former approach gets a lot more knowledge about the target function built into it.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,1,0
1472,"It's good that the paper empirically confirms the intuition, but doesn't feel like a significant contribution on its own.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1473,"- The paper would be stronger if it includes more complex tasks, e.g., TSP, and show that the same ideas can be applied to improve the learning a solver for such tasks.",coarse,arg_request,3.0,3,3
1474,"The current tasks and problem sizes are not very convincing, and the accuracy results are not very compelling.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1475,This work explores the extent to which the natural image manifold is captured by generative adversarial networks (GANs) by performing walks in the latent space of pretrained models.,coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1476,"To perform these walks, a transformation vector is learned by minimizing the distance between transformed images and the corresponding images generated from transformed latent vectors.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1477,"It is found that when traversing the latent space of the GAN along the direction of the transformation vector, that the corresponding generated images initially exhibit the desired transform (such as zooming or changing X position), but soon reach a limit where further changes in the latent vector do not result in changes to the image.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1478,"It is observed that this behaviour is likely due to bias in the dataset which the GAN is trained on, and that by exploring the limits of the generator, biases which exist in the original dataset can be revealed.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1479,"In order to increase the extents to which images can be transformed, it is shown that GANs can be trained with an augmented dataset and using a loss function that encourages transformations to lie along linear paths.",coarse,arg_structuring,5.0,5,5
1480,"Overall, I would tend towards accepting this paper.",coarse,arg_social,4.0,4,4
1481,"Improving the amount of control that we have over generative models is desirable for image synthesis, and this paper does a great job of demonstrating the extent to which these models can be manipulated in terms of mimicking basic transforms.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
1482,"Figures are very clean and informative, and experimental results are extensive.",coarse,arg_evaluative,0.0,0,0
