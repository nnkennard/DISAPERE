888,Reviewer #1 is absolutely right -- we don’t know yet how to scale this to more difficult combinatorial problems.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
889,But let’s clarify that statement a bit more:,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2

896,"On a more technical note, please note that our “machinery” of solving the two-player game is needed to discover an algorithm for the ski rental problem: if we don’t allow the players to alternate and reach an equilibrium, for any fixed distribution on the ski rental instances (B, K), there is a deterministic algorithm that is optimal (among all online algorithms), and the worst-case performance of that (or any) deterministic algorithm is *provably* limited by a factor of 2 (i.e., there exists some distribution on instances where it will fail badly).",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

1082,"In that case, applying that gradient to CEM actors as we do in CEM-RL is counter-productive.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1083,But the fact that we only apply this gradient to half the population makes it that CEM-RL should nevertheless overcome this issue:  the actors which did not receive a gradient step will be selected and the population will continue improving.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1084,"However, admittedly, in this very specific context, CEM-RL is behaving as a CEM with only half a population, thus it is less efficient than the standard CEM.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1085,"Besides, ERL even better resists than our approach to the same issue: if the actor generated by DDPG does not perform better than the evolutionary population due to a deceptive gradient issue, then this actor is just ignored, and the evolutionary part behaves as usual, without any loss in performance.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1086,This deceptive gradient issue certainly explains why CEM is the best approach on Swimmer.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

1102,"The next point of the reviewer is that a good deal of the strong performance of our method and RL may just be due to the fact that we are using multiple actors, thus benefiting from an ""ensemble method"" effect already mentioned in several papers such as Osband et al., 2016 for DQN.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
1103,This point is absolutely valid.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1104,"The reviewer thus suggests a relevant control which would be to keep a population (ensemble) of policies, but only update using RL while sharing experience across all actors.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2

1124,"First, the use of HRL enables temporal correlation in action exploration that helps reduce the non-stationarity challenge.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1125,The advantage of this temporal correlation is shown empirically in Figures 2 and 3 where the PPO policies do not improve on learning the tasks.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1126,This property can be understood to reduce the variance in the policy gradient.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

1129,"Similarly, this $k$-step structured exploration enables learning.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1130,If we think of the policy as a type of VAE that is learning an encoder (high-level) that is trying to learn a good latent goal (z) that will result in the low-level performing the desired sequence of actions.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

1518,Thank you very much.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1519,We thank the reviewer for the comments and appreciate that the reviewer likes our idea of including optimization in the network. But our contribution is beyond adopting Levenberg-Marquardt instead of Gauss-Newton.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
1520,We would like to clarify several things to address the reviewer's concerns:,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1521,Q1. The advantages of Levenberg-Marquardt over Gauss-Newton is unclear (the main reason for rejection):,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1522,"Firstly, we want to clarify that our contribution is beyond improving the Gauss-Newton optimization to Levenberg-Marquardt.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1523,"More importantly, our contribution is the combination of conventional multi-view geometry (i.e. joint optimization of depth and camera poses) and end-to-end deep learning (I.e. depth basis generator learning and feature learning).",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1524,This contribution is achieved by our differentiable LM optimization that allows end-to-end training.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1525,"Secondly, we agree with the reviewer that comparing with the Gauss-Newton algorithm will be interesting and have updated such a comparison in Appendix B in the revised version according to the reviewer’s suggestions:",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1526,"1. We retrained the whole pipeline with Gauss-Newton, to make sure the features are learned specifically for Gauss-Newton.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
1527,2. We compared with various constant lambda values to see how the performance varies along with lambda.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
1528,Note that we also fine-tune the network to make sure the features fit different lambda.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
1529,"In Table 4 of the revised version (Appendix B), our method outperforms the Gauss-Newton algorithm in the last column.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1530,"This is because the objective function to be optimized is non-convex, and the vanilla Gauss-Newton method might get stuck at saddle point or local minimum.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1531,This is why the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the standard choice for conventional bundle adjustment.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1532,"In Figure 6 of the revised version (Appendix B), our method also consistently performs better than different constant lambda values.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1533,This is because the value of lambda should be adapted to different data and optimization iterations.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1534,There is no ‘optimal’ constant lambda for all data and iterations.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1535,Q2.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2

1538,"Since there is no public code for CodeSLAM, we cite its results directly from the CodeSLAM paper.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1539,Q3. The state vector Chi is not defined for the proposed method.,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
1540,The Chi is defined in Section 3 as the vector containing all camera poses and point depths.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1541,"Since our method also solves for these unknowns as in classic methods, we did not redefine the Chi.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1542,But in the revised version we have recapped the definition of Chi when introducing our method at the beginning of Section 4.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1543,Q4. Should the paper be called Bundle Adjustment?:,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1544,The term ‘Bundle Adjustment’ is originally used to refer to the joint optimization of 3D scene points and camera poses by minimizing the reprojection error.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1545,The keyword Bundle comes from the fact that a bundle of camera view rays pass through each of the 3D scene points.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1546,"Multiple recent works, e.g. [Engel et al., 2017,Delaunoy and Pollefeys, 2014], have generalized it to “photometric BA” where scene points and camera poses are optimized together by minimizing the photometric error.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1547,Our method is along this line.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1548,But we further improve the photometric error to featuremetric error.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1549,"Each 3D scene point is still constrained by a bundle of camera view rays, though the error function has been changed.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1550,So we believe it is justified to call this method feature-metric BA.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
1551,But we agree with the reviewer that the word ‘reprojection’ is misleading when we introduce our feature-metric BA and the photometric BA.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1552,So we use the word ‘align’ as the reviewer suggested and use ‘reprojection’ only for the geometric BA.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0
1553,Q5. Is B the same for all scenes?:,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
1554,"In the revised version, We added Figure 8 to visualize of the term B in Equation 7 (Page 6) for different scenes.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

2515,"As we emphasized many times in our paper, the success of DNN in domains such as image, speech and text, is built on the comprehensive exploration of the locality-based patterns, which motivates us to first find such patterns of features in tabular data automatically and then build up NN architecture based on these discovered patterns.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1

2593,"According to Distributional Hypothesis (Harris et al., 1954) which states that “words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings”, we are inspired to extend the concept in multimodal world, “the sentences with similar meanings would be likely to pair with similar even the same images”, where the consistent images (with similar topic) could play the role of topic or type clues for similar sentence modeling.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2

2825,1. Clarify how the skills of agents play a role in the problem setup,reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,2,2
2826,We clarify the definition of skills and how it influences the manager’s decision as follows.,reb_coarse,concur,0.0,2,0
2827,"i) As defined in Section 3, an agent’s skill depends on its state transition probabilities and its policy.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

2832,"It can be inferred by the manager based on the performance history, and also on the estimated worker policies by IL.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

2834,"Failing to reach a goal may be a result of several reasons -- it may be because i) the bonus in the contract is too low, ii) the contract terminates prematurely before the agent can reach the goal, or iii) the assigned task depends on another task which has not been finished yet.",reb_coarse,concur,0.0,0,0

3275,"In particular, we demonstrate the efficacy of neural stethoscopes in interpreting, promoting and suppressing specific information in the context of the complex interplay between visual clues and physical properties in stability prediction.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
3276,Our work is primarily motivated by the question as to what extent neural networks learn about physical principles or whether they merely follow visual clues and how we can guide the learning process.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
3277,"We showcase the stethoscope framework here to that effect and, based on its application, provide some interesting and novel [according to Reviewer 1] insights into representations for visual stability prediction.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
3278,"As regards the implications of the paper, we would like to address this in the context of the reviewer’s comment that increased performance is not surprising given the additional supervision provided.",reb_coarse,nonarg,2.0,0,2
3279,Our submission argues that the manner in which this information is provided really does matter.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
3280,"Figure 6 addresses this point in that multi-task learning fails to leverage the potential of the additional training labels (and, indeed, leads to a detrimental effect, Fig 6b) whereas the stethoscope framework allows the specification of whether the information considered should be promoted or suppressed.",reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
3281,This leads to the performance gains shown in Fig 6a.,reb_coarse,dispute,1.0,0,1
