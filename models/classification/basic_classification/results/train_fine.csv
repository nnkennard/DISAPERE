230,See below for detailed comments.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
231,[Pros],fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
232,1. The main idea of the paper is to propose a generative model that can handle partially-observed multimodal data during training.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
233,"Specifically, prior work considered non-missing data during training, while we can't always guarantee that all the modalities are available.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

235,This line of work should be encouraged.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
236,"2. In my opinion, the idea is elegant.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
237,The way the author handles the missingness is by introducing an auxiliary binary random variable (the mask) for it.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
238,"Nevertheless, its presentation and Figure 1 makes this elegant idea seems over-complicated.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
239,[Cons],fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
240,1. [The claim] One of my concerns for this paper is the assumption of the factorized latent variables from multimodal data.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
241,"Specifically, the author mentioned Tsai et al. assumed factorized latent variables from the multimodal data, while Tsai et al. actually assumed the generation of multimodal data consists of disentangled modality-specific and multimodal factors.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
242,"It seems to me; the author assumed data from one modality is generated by all the latent factors (see Eq. (11)), then what is the point for assuming the prior of the latent factor is factorized (see Eq. (4) and (5))?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
243,"One possible explanation is because we want to handle the partially-observable issues from multimodal data, and it would be easier to make the latent factors factorized (see Eq. (6)).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
244,The author should comment on this.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3

270,I do expect the paper be a strong submission after a significant effort in presentation and experimental designs.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

273,"The paper proposes a new architecture for the DIP method which has much less parameters, but works on par with DIP.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
274,Another contribution of the paper is theoretical treatment of (a simplified version of) the proposed architecture showing that it can’t fit random noise (and thus maybe better suited for denoising).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
275,"The paper is clearly written, and the proposed architecture has too cool properties: it’s compact enough to be used for image compression; and it doesn’t overfit thus making early stopping notnesesary (which was crucial for the original DIP model).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
276,I have two main concerns about this paper.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
277,"First, it is somewhat misleading about its contributions: it's not obvious from abstract/introduction that the whole model is the same as DIP except for the proposed architecture.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
278,"Specifically, the first contribution listed in the introduction makes it look like this paper introduces the idea of not learning the decoder on the dataset (the one that starts with “The network is not learned and itself incorporates all assumptions on the data.”).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
279,My second concern is about the theoretical contribution.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
280,"On the one hand, I enjoyed the angle the authors tackled proving that the network architecture is underparameterized enough to be a good model for denoising.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
281,"On the other hand, the obtained results are very weak: only one layered version of the paper is analysed and the theorem applies only to networks with less than some threshold of parameters.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
282,"Roughly, the theorem states that if for example we fix any matrix B of size e.g. 256 x k and matrix U of size 512 x 256 and then compute U relu(B C) where C is the vector of parameters of size k x 1, AND if k < 2.5 (i.e. if we use at most 2 parameters), then it would be very hard to fit 512 iid gaussian values (i.e. min_C ||U relu(B C) - eta|| where eta ~ N(0, 1)).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
283,"This restriction of the number of parameters to be small is only mentioned in the theorem itself, not in the discussion of its implications.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
284,"Also, the theorem only applies to the iid noise, while most natural noise patterns have structure (e.g. JPEG artifacts, broken pixels, etc) and thus can probably be better approximated with deep models.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
285,"Since the paper manages to use very few parameters (BTW, how many parameters in total do you have? Can you please add this number to the text?), it would be cool to see if second order methods like LBFGS can be applied here.",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,2,0
286,Some less important points:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
287,Fig 4 is very confusing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

369,Weaknesses:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
370,"[-] The combination of VAEs and GANs, while new for videos, had already been proposed for image generation as indicated in the Related Work section and its formulation for video prediction is relatively straightforward given existing VAE (Denton & Fergus 2018) and GAN models (Tulyakov et al. 2018).",fine,none,9.0,9,9

373,"Furthermore, Figure 6 and Figure 7 in general show SAVP performing worse than SVG (Denton & Fergus 2018), a VAE model with a significantly less complex generator, including for the metric (VGG cosine similarity) that the authors introduce arguing that PSNR and SSIM do not necessarily indicate prediction quality.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
374,"While the use of a GAN in general will make the results less blurry and visually appealing, it does not necessarily mean that the samples it generates are going to be plausible or better.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
375,"Since a direct application of video prediction is model-based planning, it seems that plausibility might be as important as sample quality.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
376,This work proposes to combine VAEs and GANs in a single model to get the benefits of both models.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
377,"However, the experiments conducted generally show that SAVP offers only a trade-off between the visual quality of GANs and the coverage of VAEs, and does not show a clear advantage over current VAE models (Denton & Fergus, 2018) that with simpler architectures obtain similar results.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

443,"In this paper, the authors address representation learning in non-Euclidean spaces.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
444,"The authors are motivated by constant curvature geometries, that can  provide a useful trade-off between Euclidean representations and Riemannian manifolds, i.e. arriving at more suitable representations than possible in the Euclidean space, while not sacrifising closed-form formulae for estimating distances, gradients and so on.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

466,Summary of the paper:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
467,The paper has two intertwined goals.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
468,These goals are to illuminate the,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
469,generalization/memorization properties of large and deep ConvNets in,fine,none,9.0,9,9
470,tandem with trying to develop procedures related to identifying,fine,none,9.0,9,9
471,whether an input to a trained ConvNet has actually been used to train the,fine,none,9.0,9,9
472,network.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
473,The latter task is generalized to detecting if a,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
474,particular dataset has been used to train a ConvNet.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
475,These goal are,fine,none,9.0,8,9
476,tackled empirically with multiple sets of experiments on largescale,fine,none,9.0,9,9
477,datasets such as ImageNet22k and modern deep ConvNets architectures,fine,none,9.0,9,9
478,such as VGG and ResNet.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

481,touches upon.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
482,+ Some of the experimental results presented are quite,fine,none,9.0,9,9
483,interesting. They show that regularization data-augmentation helps,fine,none,9.0,9,9
484,prevent a network from explicit memorization and could be used as a,fine,none,9.0,9,9
485,way to help make training data more anonymous.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
486,+ Large scale experiments are reported on modern architectures.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
487,Paper's negative points,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
488,- The paper makes use of a result from the David MacKay textbook,fine,none,9.0,9,9
489,which defines the capacity of a single layer network to memorize the,fine,none,9.0,8,9
490,labelling of $n$ inputs in $d$-dimensional space.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
491,If I'm not,fine,none,9.0,9,9
492,"mistaken, from this result the authors extrapolate that the capacity",fine,none,9.0,9,9
493,of a (deep) neural network,fine,none,9.0,9,9
494,is proportional to the number of,fine,none,9.0,9,9
495,parameters in the network.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
496,"This is true, but there are a",fine,none,9.0,9,9
497,couple of caveats.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
498,The first is that the coefficient of,fine,none,9.0,9,9
499,proportionality must depend very much on the number of layers in the,fine,none,9.0,9,9
500,network.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
501,Increasing the network's depth increases the efficiency of,fine,none,9.0,9,9
502,the representation (i.e. fewer total parameters needed to have the,fine,none,9.0,9,9
503,same representational power as a shallow network). And as MacKay,fine,none,9.0,9,9
504,also says in his book (chapter 44 quoting findings from Radford,fine,none,9.0,9,9
505,Neal) that for MLPs what determines the complexity of the typical,fine,none,9.0,9,9
506,function (once the network has a large enough width) represented by,fine,none,9.0,9,9
507,"the MLP is the ""characteristic magnitude of the weights"". So the",fine,none,9.0,9,9
508,regularization technique applied is very significant in the,fine,none,9.0,9,9
509,controlling the effective capacity of a network.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
510,This paper,fine,none,9.0,9,9
511,experimentally shows that is the case multiple times as it is shown,fine,none,9.0,9,9
512,"that with increasing degrees of regularization (figure 1, figure 2)",fine,none,9.0,9,9
513,it becomes harder and harder to memorize the positive training,fine,none,9.0,9,9
514,images. It would be great if the paper also made some attempt to,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
515,consider these connections. Or at least comment on how these factors,fine,none,9.0,9,9
516,could be incorporated into a more sophisticated analysis of the,fine,none,9.0,9,9
517,capacity of a network.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
518,- There is a slight oxymoron in the premise of the first set of,fine,none,9.0,9,9
519,experiments.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
520,The network is forced to memorize a set of,fine,none,9.0,9,9
521,positive examples relative to the negative set it sees during,fine,none,9.0,9,9
522,training. What is memorized I presume depends a lot on the negative,fine,none,9.0,9,9
523,"set used for training (its diversity, closeness to the positive set",fine,none,9.0,9,9
524,and how frequently each negative example is seen during,fine,none,9.0,9,9
525,training).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
526,This issue is not really commented upon in the paper. Is,fine,none,9.0,9,9
527,there a training task which would allow one to more explicitly,fine,none,9.0,8,9
528,memorize the image (some sort of reconstruction task) as opposed to,fine,none,9.0,9,9
529,an in/out classification task?,fine,none,9.0,9,9
530,- This paper is a slightly difficult read - not because of the,fine,none,9.0,9,9
531,language or the presentation of the material but more because there,fine,none,9.0,9,9
532,is not one main coherent argument or goal for the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

535,issues/tasks are referred to.,fine,none,9.0,8,9

539,For example in section 3 the paper,fine,none,9.0,9,9
540,explores if a network can be forced to explicitly memorize a set of,fine,none,9.0,9,9
541,images and how the size of this set is affected by the number of,fine,none,9.0,9,9
542,parameters in the network and data augmentation.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
543,High-level,fine,none,9.0,9,9
544,conclusions are made: more parameters in the network implies more,fine,none,9.0,8,9
545,images can be memorized and data-augmentation makes explicit,fine,none,9.0,9,9
546,memorization more difficult. Then it is off to considering,fine,none,9.0,9,9
547,pre-trained networks and determining whether by analyzing,fine,none,9.0,9,9
548,the,fine,none,9.0,9,9
549,statistics of the responses at different layers one can decide if a,fine,none,9.0,9,9
550,set of images was used for training or not (or similar tasks).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
551,Yes,fine,none,9.0,9,9
552,the different sections are related but it is does not feel like they,fine,none,9.0,9,9

700,The paper proposes a way to pre-train quantized representations for speech.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
701,The approach proposed is a two-stage process: 1. train a quantized version of wav2vec [my understanding is that wav2vec is the same thing as CPC for Audio except for using a binary cross-entropy loss instead of InfoNCE softmax-cross entropy loss].,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
702,the authors propose to use gumbel softmax / VQ codebook for the vector quantization.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
703,"2. once you have a discrete representation, you could train BERT (as if it were a seq of language tokens).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
704,this makes a lot of sense especially given that CPC / wav2vec recovers phonemes and quantizing the phonemes will recover a language-like version of the raw audio. And running BERT across those tokens will allow you to capture the dependencies at the phoneme level.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8

711,This paper explores maximally expressive linear layers for jointly exchangeable data and in doing so presents a surprisingly expressive model.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
712,I have given it a strong accept because the paper takes a very well-studied area (convolutions on graphs) and manages to find a far more expressive model (in terms of numbers of parameters) than what was previously known by carefully exploring the implications of the equivariance assumptions implied by graph data.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
713,"The result is particularly interesting because the same question was asked about exchangeable matrices (instead of *jointly* exchangeable matrices) by Hartford et al. [2018] which lead to a model with 4 bases instead of the 15 bases in this model, so the additional assumption of joint exchangeability (i.e. that any permutations applied to rows of a matrix must also be applied to columns - or equivalently, the indices of the rows and columns of a matrix refer to the same items / nodes) gives far more flexibility but without losing anything with respect to the Hartford et al result (because it can be recovered using a bipartite graph construction - described below).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
714,So we have a case where an additional assumption is both useful (in that it allows for the definition of a more flexible model) and benign (because it doesn't prevent the layer from being used on the data explored in Hartford et al.).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
715,I only have a couple of concerns:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
716,1 - I would have liked to see more discussion about why the two results differ to give readers intuition about where the extra flexibility comes from.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3
717,The additional parameters of this paper come from having parameters associated with the diagonal (intuitively: self edges get treated differently to other edges) and having parameters for the transpose of the matrix (intuitively: incoming edges are different to outgoing edges).,fine,none,9.0,8,9
718,Neither of these assumptions apply in the exchangeable setting (where the matrix may not be square so the diagonal and transpose can't be used).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
719,"Because these differences aren't explained, the synthetic tasks in the experimental section make this approach look artificially good in comparison to Hartford et al.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,9,3
720,"The tasks are explicitly designed to exploit these additional parameters - so framing the synthetic experiments as, ""here are some simple functions for which we would need the additional parameters that we define"" makes sense; but arguing that Hartford et al. ""fail approximating rather simple functions"" (page 7) is misleading because the functions are precisely the functions on which you would expect Hartford et al. to fail (because it's designed for a different setting).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
721,"2 - Those more familiar of the graph convolution literature will be more familiar with GCN [kipf et al. 2016] / GraphSAGE [Hamilton et al. 2017] / Monti et al [2017] / etc..

724,"This is the case when you map an exchangeable matrix into a jointly exchangeable matrix by representing it as a bipartite graph [0, X; X^T, 0].",fine,none,9.0,9,9

968,This paper addresses the computational aspects of Viterbi-based encoding for neural networks.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
969,"In usual Viterbi codes, input messages are encoded via a convolution with a codeword, and then decoded using a trellis.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
970,"Now consider a codebook with n convolutional codes, of rate 1/k.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
971,Then a vector of length n is represented by inputing a message of length k and receiving n encoded bits.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
972,Then the memory footprint (in terms of messages) is reduced by rate k/n.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
973,"This is the format that will be used to encode the row indices in a matrix, with n columns.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
974,(The value of each nonzero is stored separately.),fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
975,"However, it is clear that not all messages are possible, only those in the ""range space"" of my codes. (This part is previous work Lee 2018.)",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
976,"The ""Double Viterbi"" (new contribution) refers to the storage of the nonzero values themselves.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
977,"A weakness of CSR and CSC (carried over to the previous work) is that since each row may have a different number of nonzeros, then finding the value of any particular nonzero requires going through the list to find the right corresponding nonzero, a sequential task.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
978,"Instead, m new Viterbi decompressers are included, where each row becomes (s_1*codeword_1 + s_2*codeword2 + ...) cdot mask, and the new scalar are the results of the linear combinations of the codewords.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

1012,The drawbacks  of the work include the following: (1) There is not much technical contribution.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1013,It merely just puts the CNN representation learning and the label propagation together to perform end-to-end learning.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1014,"Considering the optimization problem involved in the learning process, it is hard to judge whether the effect of such a procedure from the optimization perspective.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

1019,Summary:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6

1413,"Thanks for the results, but I have several questions.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
1414,"First, In Theorem 2, which seems to be a main result of the paper, the authors were concerned with the condition when W_{ji} >0, but there is not conclusion if W_{ji} =0.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1415,"In order to correctly estimate causal relations from data, both cases must be considered.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1416,"Second, the conclusion of Theorem 2 seems to be flawed.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1417,Let me try to make it clear with the following example.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1418,"Suppose x^1_{t-2} directly causes x^2_{t-1} and that x^2_{t-1} directly causes x^3_{t}, without a direct influence from x^1_{t-2}  to x^3_{t}. Then when minimizing (2), we have the following results step by step:",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1419,"1) The noise standard deviation in x^2_{t-1}, denoted by \eta_2, may be non-zero.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1420,"This is because we minimize a tradeoff of the prediction error (the first term in (2)) and a function of the reciprocal of the noise standard deviation \eta_2 (the second term in (2)), not only the prediction error.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1421,"2) If \eta_2 is non-zero, then x^1_{t-2} will be useful for the purpose of predicting x^3_{t}. (Note that if \eta_2 is zero, then x^1_{t-2} is not useful for predicting x^3_{t).) From the d-separation perspective, this is because x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not d-separated by x^2_{t-1} + \eta_2 \cdot \epsilon_2, although they are d-separated by x^2_{t-1}. Then the causal Markov condition tells use that x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not independent conditional on x^2_{t-1} + \eta_2 \cdot \epsilon_2, which means that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1422,"3) Given that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}, when (2) is minimized, \eta_1 will not go to infinity, resulting in a non-zero W_{13), which *mistakenly* tells us that X^{1}_{t-1} directly structurally causes x^{(3)}_t.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1423,This illustrates that the conclusion of Theorem 2 may be wrong.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1424,I believe this is because the proof of Theorem 2 is flawed in lines 5-6 on Page 16.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1425,It does not seem sensible to drop X^{j}_{t-1} + \eta_X \cdot \epsilon_X and attain a smaller value of the cost function at the same time.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1426,"Please carefully check it, especially the argument given in lines 10-13.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1427,"Third, it is rather surprising that the authors didn't mention anything about the traditional causal discovery methods based on conditional independence relations in the data, known as constraint-based methods, such as the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 1993), IC algorithm (Pearl, 2000), and FCI (Spirtes et al., 1993).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1428,Such methods are directly applicable to time-delayed causal relations by further considering the constraint that effects temporally follow the causes.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

1545,## Specific Comments and Questions ##,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1546,1. Cakewalk is *very* closely related to the cross-entropy method.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1547,"The authors acknowledge this connection, but I think they should begin by introducing CE and then explain how Cakewalk generalizes it.",fine,arg-request_edit,1.0,1,1

1549,"The difference is that Cakewalk uses the CDF directly, while CE uses a threshold function on the CDF.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
1550,2. The distribution proposed in section 3.2 assumes independence between the elements $x_j$. This seems problematic for some relatively simple problems.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
1551,Consider $x$ a binary vector and reward equal to the parity $S(x) = \sum{x_j} % 2$.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

1582,Overview:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
1583,This paper considers unsupervised (or self-supervised) discrete representation learning of speech using a combination of a recent vector quantized neural network discritization method and future time step prediction.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

2009,"- Regarding the diversity/fidelity tradeoff using different truncation thresholds, I think constraining the norm of the sampled noise vectors to the exact threshold value (by projecting the samples on the 0-centered hyper-sphere of radius = threshold) could yield even more interesting or more informative Figures, as obtained scores or samples on the edge of that hyper-sphere might provide information on the ‘guaranteed’ (not proven) quality/fidelity of samples mapped from inside that hyper-sphere.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

2072,The paper in general is well written and easy to follow.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2073,I have some concerns regarding the presentation of the main objective and the lack of justification in certain parts of the methodology.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2074,Let me elaborate.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2075,"First of all, I don’t understand how the main equation of the compound density network in Equation (3) is different from the general case of a Bayesian neural network? Can the authors please comment on that?",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
2076,I also find weird the way that the authors arrive to their final objective in Equation (5).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2077,They start from Equation (4) which is incorrectly denoted as the log-marginal distribution while it is the same conditional distribution introduced in Equation (3) with the extra summation for all the available data points.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2078,Then they continue to Equation (5) which they present as the combination of the true likelihood with a KL regularisation term.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2079,"However, what the authors implicitly did was to perform variational inference for maximising their likelihood by introducing a variational distribution q(\theta) = p(\theta | g(x_n; \psi).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2080,Is there a reason why the authors do not introduce their objective by following the variational framework?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
2081,"Furthermore, in the beginning of Section 3.1 the authors present their idea on probabilistic hypernetoworks which “maps x to a distribution over parameters instead of specific value \theta.” How is this different from the case that we were considering so far? If we had a point estimate for \theta we would not require to take an expectation in Equation (3) in the first place.",fine,none,9.0,3,9
2082,"My biggest concern in the methodology, however, has to do with the selection of the matrix variate normal prior for the weights and the imposition of diagonal covariances (diag(a) and diag(b)).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2083,"The Kronecker product between two diagonal matrices results in another diagonal matrix, i.e., diagonal covariance, which implies that the weights within a layer are given by an independent multivariate Gaussian.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
2084,What is the purpose then for introducing the matrix variate Gaussian?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
2085,I would expect that you would like to impose additional structure to the weights.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2086,I expect the authors to comment on that.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,2,3
2087,Regarding the experimental evaluation of the model rather confusing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2088,The authors have proposed a model that due to the mixing is better suited for predictions with heteroscedastic noise and can better quantify the aleatoric uncertainty.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
2089,"However, the selected experiments on the cubic regression toy data (Section 5.1) and the out-of-distribution classification (Section 5.2) are clear examples of system’s noise, i.e. epistemic uncertainty.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2090,The generative process of the toy data clearly states that there is no heteroscedastic noise to handle.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2091,"The same applies for the notMNIST data which belong to a completely different data set compared to MNIST and thus out of sample prediction cannot benefit from the mixing; i.e., variations have to be explained by system’s noise.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2092,So overall I have the feeling that the authors have not succeeded to evaluate the model’s power with these two experiments and we cannot draw any strong conclusions regarding the benefit of the proposed mixing approach.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2093,"To continue with the experimental evaluation, I found the plots with the predictive uncertainty in Figure 3 a bit confusing.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2094,"The plot by itself, as I understood, quantifies the model’s uncertainty in in- and out-of sample prediction.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2095,"While I agree with the authors that it is generally desirable for a model to be more confident when predicting in MNIST (since it has already seen samples of it) compared to when predicting in notMNIST (completely different data), these plots tells us nothing regarding the predictive power of the model.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2096,"There is no value in being very confident if you are wrong and vice-versa, so unless there is an accompanying plot/table reporting the accuracy I see not much value from this plot alone.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2097,"Finally, it is unclear how the authors have picked the best \lambda parameter for their approach? On page 5 they state that they “pick the value that results in a good trade-off between high uncertainty estimates and high prediction accuracy.” Does this mean that you get to observe the performance in the test in order to select the appropriate value for \lambda? If this is the case this is completely undesirable and is considered a bad practice.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3

2105,"(iii) a “discriminator” network that aims to distinguish points from a *given* shape, and the points produced by pipe-lining the encoder and decoder.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2106,"Critically different from conventional GANs, the discriminator is optimized *per shape*, ie each point cloud is considered as a *distribution* over R^3 specific to that shape.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2107,"(iv) a “shape prior” that, once the encoder-decoder model from above is trained, is used to model the distribution over the global latent variables.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2108,"This model is trained, presumably, in a conventional GAN style using the global latent variable representations inferred across the different training point clouds.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

2110,"In addition, the authors propose to minimize a weighted average of a lower bound and upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of points corresponding to given shapes.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2111,"This approach translates to improved quantitative evaluation measures,",fine,none,9.0,9,9

2559,I wonder why the numbers are so different.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
2560,"Maybe it's because of different scales? Previous works usually scale each pixel to [0,1] or [-1,1], maybe the authors use the [0, 255] scale? But 0.1/255 will be much smaller than 0.031.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3

2593,[Summary]:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
2594,This paper tackles the problem of automatic robot design.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2595,The most popular approach to doing this has been evolutionary methods which work by evolving morphology of agents in a feed-forward manner using a propagation and mutation rules.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2596,This is a non-differentiable process and relies on maintaining a large pool of candidates out of which best ones are chosen with the highest fitness.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2597,"In robot design for a given task using rewards, training each robot design using RL with rewards is an expensive process and not scalable.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8

2605,=> Robot design area has been explored extensively in classical work of Sims (1994) etc. using ES.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2606,"Given that, the novelty of the paper is fairly incremental as it uses NerveNet to evaluate fitness and ES for the main design search.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

2610,"At first, it compares to random graph search and ES.",fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,8,7
2611,But there are better baselines possible.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2612,One such example would be to have a network for each body part and share parameters across each body part.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

2616,This baseline can be thought of a shared parameter graph with no message passing.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2617,=> The results shown in Figure-4 (Section-4.2) seems unclear to me.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2618,"As far as I understand, the model starts with hand-engineered design and then finetuned using evolutionary process.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

2623,"Overall, this is a reasonable paper but experimental section needs much more attention.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2624,"In this paper, the authors propose a method for dimensionality reduction of image data.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2625,They provide a structured and deterministic function G that maps a set of parameters C to an image X = G(C).,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
2626,"The number of parameters C is smaller than the number of free parameters in the image X, so this results in a predictive model that can be used for compression, denoising, inpainting, superresolution and other inverse problems.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

2629,"This approach makes sense and the model is indeed more principled than the one taken by Ulyanov et al.

2952,Overall the paper is well written.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2953,"However, there are several concerns about this paper.",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
2954,"In fact, the key results obtained in this paper is that minimizing the KL-divergence between the parametric policy and the optimal policy (Nash equilibrium) (using SGD) will converge to the optimal policy.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

2956,"This bound is not so surprising because as long as certain regularity condition holds, the policies being close should lead to the returns being close.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

2958,"As mentioned earlier, the actual conclusion in Section 4.2 is that minimizing the KL-divergence between the parametric policy and the optimal policy by SGD will converge to the optimal policy, which is straightforward and is not what AlphaGo Zero does.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
2959,This is because there is an important gap: the MCTS policy is not the same as the optimal policy.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2960,The effect of the imperfection in the target policy is not taken into account in the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
2961,"A more interesting question to study is how this gap affect the iterative algorithm, and whether/how the error in the imperfect target policy accumulates/diminishes so that iteratively minimizing KL-divergence with imperfect \pi* (by MCTS) could still lead to optimal policy (Nash equilibrium).",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
2962,"Furthermore, the robust MDP view of the AGZ in sequential decision-making problems is not so impressive either.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

3199,Any justification?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3

3230,The authors propose a generative model of networks by learning embeddings and pairing the embeddings with a prior distribution over networks.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3231,The idea is that the prior distribution may explain structure that the embeddings would not have to capture.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
3232,The motivation for doing this is that this structure is typically hard to model for network embeddings.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

3261,The proposed regularization strategy enforces that a discriminator or a given classifier should be invariant to small perturbations on the data manifold z. It is empirically shown that naively enforcing such a constraint by randomly adding noise to z could lead to under-smoothing or over-smoothing in some cases which can harm the final classification performance.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

3288,"At the conceptual level, the idea of jointly modeling local video events is not novel, and can date back to at least ten years ago in the paper “Learning realistic human actions from movies”, where the temporal pyramid matching was combined with the bag-of-visual-words framework to capture long-term temporal structure.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

3829,1. The proposed model? Is using a conditional weight prior p(\theta | x) (Eq 3) instead of p(\theta) (as in BNNs)  necessary for the inflated uncertainties on OOD data?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
3830,"2. The  objective? The proposed objective,  Eq 5, trades off stochastically approximating the (conditional) marginal likelihood against not deviating too much from p(\theta) =  MN(0, I, I) in the KL sense.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3

3832,It is unclear how important this particular objective is to the results.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3833,"-  Instead of relying on the KL regularizer, a standard approach to learning the model in Eq 3 would be to use well understood MCMC or variational methods that explicitly retain uncertainty in \theta and induce predictive uncertainties.

3870,"However, this paper rather than proposing solution address the meta-learning problem, albeit the title “meta domain adaptation”, only brings few-shot learning to domain adaptation.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3871,Here’s why:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3872,"In order for a meta-learning model to be called “meta domain adaptation,” the type of adaptation cannot be seen during training, and the goal is to test on adaptation that the model has not seen before.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3873,"Indeed, each task in meta domain adaptation should be seen as a pair of source task and target task.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3874,"The problem with the current model is that during training, it is trained to target at one specific type of test domain--the generator network G aims to generated images that align with the unsupervised  test domain X_test.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3875,"Thus, the trained model will also only be able to handle one test domain, not much different than regular meta-learning models.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3876,"In short, the meta-learning part stays in the regular few-shot learning module (which is implemented as a prototypical network), and has nothing related to domain adaptation.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3877,"Therefore, the paper cannot be qualified for ``meta domain adaptation’’ and has very limited novelty in terms of its contribution to meta-learning; however, the combination of domain adaptation and few-shot learning is fair.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3878,"For the rest of my review, I will treat the paper as “few-shot learning with domain adaptation” for more appropriate analysis.",fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,1,7
3879,"For the experiments, there seems to have a great win of the proposed algorithm against the baselines.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3880,"However, I think since this is few-shot learning with domain adaptation, there is no domain adaptation baselines being mentioned in comparison.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3881,"Specifically, what if the few-shot learning component is removed, and the network is trained with standard domain adaptation.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
3882,Then use the same network to extract the features and then using the nearest neighbor to retrieve the classes.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
3883,"Also it seems that the regular batch normalization could be very sensitive to domain shifts, and it would be good if the authors can test other normalization schemes such as layer/group normalization as baselines.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
3884,Another concern is that the evaluation of domain adaptation does not have much varieties.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3885,"Only two domains shifts are evaluated in the paper, specifically Omniglot + BSD500 and Office-Home.",fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7

3899,"The experiments use fairly small datasets, where the performance can be largely influenced by how good the feature extractor backbone is (e.g. training on more data and using deeper architecture would warrant better performance, and thus may change the conclusion).",fine,none,9.0,9,9

3902,Some of the claims in the paper can be further substantiated or explored.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3903,For example in abstract there is a simple claim that is presented too strong: We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3904,This claim is bigger than just CNNs and needs to be studied in a theoretical framework not an empirical one.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3905,"Also, one simple way to stop these adversarial cases would be to explore using Sigmoid as opposed to softmax.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

3917,The paper has several strong points.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

3919,"Much of the relevant related work is discussed, and this is done in a balanced way.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3920,"Although it is not directly measured, it does seem highly likely that the alt-az convolution is more computationally efficient than SO(3) convolution, and more expressive than isotropic S2 convolution.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3921,"The most important contribution in my opinion is the efficient data structure presented in section 4, which allows the spherical convolution to be computed efficiently on GPUs for a grid that is much more homogeneous than the lat/lon grids used in previous works (which have very high resolution near the poles, and low resolution at the equator).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3922,"The idea of carving up the icosahedral grid in just the right way, so that the spherical convolution can be computed as a planar convolution with funny boundary conditions, is very clever, elegant, and practical.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3923,# Weaknesses,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
3924,There is however a misunderstanding about the properties of the alt-az convolution that must be cleared up before this paper can be published.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3925,"To start with, the set of rotations R(phi, nu, 0) called the alt-az group in this paper is not a group in the mathematical sense.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3926,"This easy to see, because a composition of rotations of the form Rz(phi) Ry(nu) is not generally of that form.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3927,"For instance we can multiply Rz(phi) Ry(nu) by the element Rz(omega)Ry(0) = Rz(omega), which gives the element Rz(phi) Ry(nu) Rz(omega).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3928,"As noted in the paper, this is a general element of SO(3) (and hence not in the set of alt-az rotations)",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3929,.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3930,So the closure axiom of a group is violated.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3931,"This matters, because the notion of equivariance really only makes sense for a group.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3932,"If a layer l satisfies l R = R l  (for R a alt-az rotation), then it automatically satisfies l RR' = RR' l, which means l is equivariant to the whole group generated by the set of alt-az rotations.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3933,"As we saw before, this is the whole rotation group.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3934,"This would mean that the layer is actually SO(3)-equivariant, but it has been proven [1], that any rotation equivariant layer between scalar spherical feature maps can be expressed as an azimuthally isotropic convolution.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3935,"Since the alt-az convolution is not isotropic and maps between scalars on S2, it cannot be equivariant.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3936,"This also becomes apparent in the experiments section, where rotational data augmentation is found to be necessary.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3937,"The paper does not contain an attempted proof of equivariance, and if one tries to give one, the impossibility of doing so will become apparent.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3938,I note that the alt-az convolution *is* equivariant to rotations in the subgroup SO(2) of rotations around the Z-axis.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3939,Another somewhat jarring fact about the alt-az convolution is that it is not well defined on the south pole.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3940,"The south pole can be represented by any pair of coordinates of the form phi in [0, 2pi], nu = +/- pi.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3941,"But it is easy to see that eq. 10 will give different results for each of these coordinates, because they correspond to different rotations of the filter about the Z-axis.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3942,"This is ultimately due to the fact that the set of alt-az rotations is not the same as the set of points on the sphere, topologically speaking.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3943,The set of points on the sphere can only be viewed as the quotient SO(3)/S(2).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
3944,"The paragraph motivating the alt-az convolution on page 4 is not very clear, and some claims are questionable.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
3945,"I agree that local SO(2) invariance is too limiting. But it is not true that rotating filters is not effective in planar/volumetric CNNs, as shown by many recent papers on equivariant networks.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

4022,"This paper proposes Direct Sparse Optimization (DSO)-NAS, which is a method to obtain neural architectures on specific problems, at a reasonable computational cost.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4023,"The main idea is to treat all architectures as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each architecture is realized by a subgraph.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4024,"All architectures in the search space thus share their weights, like ENAS (Pham et al 2018) and DARTS (Liu et al 2018a).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4025,The DAG’s edges can be pruned via a sparsity regularization term.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4026,The optimization objective of DSO-NAS is thus:,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4027,"Accuracy + L2-regularization(W) + L1-sparsity(\lambda),",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
4028,where W is the shared weights and \lambda specifies which edges in the DAG are used.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4029,There are 3 phases of optimization:,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,6,8
4030,1. All edges are activated and the shared weights W are trained using normal SGD.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4031,Note that this step does not involve \lambda.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
4032,"2. \lambda is trained using Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG, Huang and Wang 2018).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4033,3. The best architecture is selected and retrained from scratch.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4034,This procedure works for all architectures and objectives.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4035,"However, DSO-NAS further proposes to incorporate the computation expense of architectures into step (2) above, leading to their found architectures having fewer parameters and a smaller FLOP counts.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4036,"Their experiments confirm all the hypotheses (DSO-NAS can find architectures, having small FLOP counts, having good performances on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet).",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4037,Strengths:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4038,1. Regularization by sparsity is a neat idea.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4039,2. The authors claim to be the first NAS algorithm to perform direct search on ImageNet.,fine,arg-structuring_quote,7.0,9,7
4040,"Honestly, I cannot confirm this claim (not sure if I have seen all NAS papers out there), but if it is the case, then it is impressive.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4041,3. Incorporating architecture costs into the search objective is nice.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4042,"However, this contribution seems to be orthogonal to the sparsity regularization, which, I suppose, is the main point of the paper.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

4081,"I think this is a very interesting area to explore, and the paper is clearly written and presented.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
4082,"As the authors admit, the main result is not especially surprising.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4083,"I think everyone agrees that we can design models that show particular kinds of generalization by carefully building inductive bias into the architecture, and that it's easy to make these work on the right toy data.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

4094,"The authors consider the setting of a RL agent that exclusively receives intrinsic reward during training that is intended to model curiosity; technically, ‘curiosity’ is quantified by the ability of the agent to predict its own forward dynamics [Pathak, et al., ICML17].",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

4101,"However, it isn’t entirely clear if the primary contribution is showing that ‘curiosity reward’ is a potentially promising approach or if game environments aren’t particularly good testbeds for practical RL algorithms — given the lack of significant results on more realistic domains, my intuition leans toward the later (the ant robot is interesting, but one can come up with ‘simulator artifact’ based explanations).",fine,none,9.0,9,9

4151,"For the same set of regularizers and the MNIST dataset, the paper then explores the mutual information between the inputs and the hidden layer activations.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4152,The paper observes that the best performing regularizer is the one which minimizes this mutual information.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

4168,"Need to compare in more challenging settings where the success rate is meaningful, e.g. smaller epsilon or a more robust NN using some defence.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2

4171,attack seems odd.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4172,-The average distortion metric (that’s unfavourable to your method anyway) doesn’t really mean anything as the constraint optimization has no incentive to find a value smaller than the constraint.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4173,"- Regarding lambda>1, you write that “we argue this modification makes our algorithm more general, and gives rise to better attack results”.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4174,I did not see any theoretical or empirical support for this in the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

4376,- Cons,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4377,"- The search space of the proposed method, such as the number of operations in the convolution block, is limited.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4378,- The proposed method does not outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4379,"- The technical contribution of the proposed method is not high, because the architecture space of neural network is similar to the prior works.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4380,"Overall, if we focus on the balance between the classification accuracy and computational efficiency, the proposed method is promising.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4381,The paper investigates the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for constructing adversarial examples both in a white-box and black-box setting.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
4382,The authors provide both a theoretical analysis (convergence to a stationary point) and experiments for an InceptionV3 network on ImageNet.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
4383,"The main claim is that the proposed algorithm can construct adversarial examples faster than various baselines (PGD, I-FGSM, CW, etc.), and from fewer queries in a black-box setting.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4384,"The FW algorithm is a classical method in optimization, but (to the best of my knowledge) has not yet been evaluated yet for constructing adversarial examples.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4385,Hence it is a natural question to understand whether FW performs significantly better than current algorithms in this context.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4386,"Indeed, the authors find that FW is 6x - 20x faster for constructing white-box adversarial examples than a range of relevant baseline, which is a significant speed-up.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4387,"However, there are several points about the experiments that are unclear to me:",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4388,- It is well known that the running times of optimization algorithms are highly dependent on various hyperparameters such as the step size.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4389,But the authors do not seem to describe how they chose the hyperparameters for the baselines algorithms.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4390,Hence it is unclear how large the running time improvement is compared to a well-tuned baseline.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4391,- Other algorithms in the comparison achieve a better distortion (smaller perturbation).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4392,"Since finding an adversarial with smaller perturbation is a harder problem, it is unclear how the algorithms compare for finding adversarial examples with similar distortion.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4393,"Instead of reporting a single time-vs-distortion data point, the authors could show the full trade-off curve.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
4394,"- The authors only provide running times, not the number of iterations.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,9,2
4395,"In principle all the algorithms should have a similar bottleneck in each iteration (computing a gradient for the input image), but it would be good to verify this with an iteration count vs success rate (or distortion) plot.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
4396,This would also allow the authors to compare their theoretical iteration bound with experimental data.,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
4397,"In addition to these three main points, the authors could strengthen their results by providing experiments on another dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) or model architecture (e.g., a ResNet), and by averaging over a larger number of test data points (currently 200).",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2

4399,Additional comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4400,The introduction contains a few statements that may paint an incomplete or confusing picture of the current literature in adversarial attacks on neural networks:,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4401,* The abstract claims that the poor time complexity of adversarial attacks limits their practical usefulness.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4402,"However, the running time of attacks is typically measured in seconds and should not be the limiting element in real-world attacks on deep learning systems.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4403,I am not aware of a setting where the running time of an attack is the main computational bottleneck (outside adversarial training).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4404,"* The introduction distinguishes between ""gradient-based methods"" and ""optimization-based methods"".",fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
4405,"This distinction is potentially confusing to a reader since the gradient-based methods can be seen as optimization algorithms, and the optimization-based methods rely on gradients.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4406,* The introduction claims that black-box attacks need to estimate gradients coordinate-wise.,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,9,6
4407,"However, this is not the case already in some of the prior work that uses random directions for estimating gradients (e.g., the cited paper by Ilyas et al.)",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4408,I encourage the authors to clarify these points in an updated version of their paper.,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,1,0
4409,This paper proposes to extend VAE-GAN from the static image generation setting to the video generation setting.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4410,"It’s a well-written, simple paper that capitalizes on the trade-off between model realism and diversity, and the fact that VAEs and GANs (at least empirically) tend to lie on different sides of this spectrum.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4411,The idea to extend the use of VAE-GANs to the video prediction setting is a pretty natural one and not especially novel.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4412,"However, the effort to implement it successfully is commendable and will, I think, serve as a good reference for future work on video prediction.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4413,There are also several interesting design choices that I think are worth of further exposition.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4414,"Why, for example, did the authors only perform variational inference with the current and previous frames? Did conditioning on additional frames offer limited further improvement? Can the blurriness instead be attributable to the weak inference model?",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
4415,Please provide a response to these questions.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4416,"If the authors have any ablation studies to back up their design choices, that would also be much appreciated, and will make this a more valuable paper for readers.",fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,2,0
4417,I think Figure 5 is the most interesting figure in the paper.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4418,I would imagine that playing with the hyperparameters would allow one to traverse the trade-off between realism and diversity.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4419,I think having such a curve will help sell the paper as giving the practitioner the freedom to select their own preferred trade-off.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4420,I don’t understand the claim that “GANs prioritize matching joint distributions of pixels over per-pixel reconstruction” and its implication that VAEs do not prioritize joint distribution matching.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4421,"VAEs prioritize matching joint distributions of pixels and latent space: min KL(q(z, x) || p(z, x)) and is a variational approximation of the problem min KL(q(x) || p(x)), where q(x) is the data distribution.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

4440,This paper provide a method to produce adversarial attack using a Frank-Wolfe inspired method.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
4441,I have some concerns about the motivation of this method:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4442,- What are the motivations to use Frank-Wolfe ? Usually this algorithm is used when the constraints are to complicated to have a tractable projection (which is not the case for the L_2 and L_\infty balls) or when one wants to have sparse iterates which do not seem to be the case here.,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
4443,- Consequently why did not you compare simple projected gradient method ?,fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
4444,(BIM) is not equivalent to the projected gradient method since the direction chosen is the sign of the gradient and not the gradient itself (the first iteration is actually equivalent because we start at the center of the box but after both methods are no longer equivalent).,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4445,"- There is no motivations for the use of $\lambda >1$ neither practical or theoretical since the results are only proven for $\lambda =1$ whereas the experiments are done with \lambda = 5,20 or 30.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4446,- What is the difference between the result of Theorem 4.3 and the result from (Lacoste-Julien 2016)?,fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
4447,Depending on the answer to these questions I'm planning to move up or down my grade.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

4461,===== After rebuttal ======,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4462,The authors answered some of my questions but I still think it is a borderline submission.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4463,The paper examines an architectural feature in GAN generators -- self-modulation -- and presents empirical evidence supporting the claim that it helps improve modeling performance.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
4464,The self-modulation mechanism itself is implemented via FiLM layers applied to all convolutional blocks in the generator and whose scaling and shifting parameters are predicted as a function of the noise vector z.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
4465,"Performance is measured in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for models trained with and without self-modulation on a fairly comprehensive range of model architectures (DCGAN-based, ResNet-based), discriminator regularization techniques (gradient penalty, spectral normalization), and datasets (CIFAR10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, ImageNet).",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4466,The takeaway is that self-modulation is an architectural feature that helps improve modeling performance by a significant margin in most settings.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4467,"An ablation study is also performed on the location where self-modulation is applied, showing that it is beneficial across all locations but has more impact towards the later layers of the generator.",fine,none,9.0,8,9
4468,"I am overall positive about the paper: the proposed idea is simple, but is well-explained and backed by rigorous evaluation.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4469,Here are the questions I would like the authors to discuss further:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4470,- The proposed approach is a fairly specific form of self-modulation.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4471,"In general, I think of self-modulation as a way for the network to interact with itself, which can be a local interaction, like for squeeze-and-excitation blocks.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4472,"In the case of this paper, the self-interaction allows the noise vector z to interact with various intermediate features across the generation process, which for me appears to be different than allowing intermediate features to interact with themselves.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4473,"This form of noise injection at various levels of the generator is also close in spirit to what BigGAN employs, except that in the case of BigGAN different parts of the noise vector are used to influence different parts of the generator.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4474,Can you clarify how you view the relationship between the approaches mentioned above?,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,3,0
4475,"- It’s interesting to me that the ResNet architecture performs better with self-modulation in all settings, considering that one possible explanation for why self-modulation is helpful is that it allows the “information” contained in the noise vector to better propagate to and influence different parts of the generator.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4476,"ResNets also have this ability to “propagate” the noise signal more easily, but it appears that having a self-modulation mechanism on top of that is still beneficial.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4477,I’m curious to hear the authors’ thoughts in this.,fine,arg-request_clarification,0.0,2,0
4478,"- Reading Figure 2b, one could be tempted to draw a correlation between the complexity of the dataset and the gains achieved by self-modulation over the baseline (e.g., Bedroom shows less difference between the two approaches than ImageNet). Do the authors agree with that?",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,3,2
4479,The paper proposed a novel image classifier comparison approach that went beyond one fixed testing set for all.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4480,"Instead, for a pair of classifiers to be compared, it advocated to sample their ""most disagreed"" test set from a large corpus of unlabeled images.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4481,The level of disagreement was measured by a semantic-aware distance derived from WordNet ontology.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4482,"Because of the efficacy of such ""worst-case"" comparison, the needed set size is very small and thus minimizes the human annotation workload.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,9,8
4483,The proposed MAD competition distinguishes classifiers by finding their respective counterexamples.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4484,"It is therefore an ""error spotting"" mechanism, rather than a drop-in replacement of standard test accuracy.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4485,"I feel the approach to implicitly assume that the classifiers to be compared are already ""reasonably accurate""; since if not, both classifiers might be easily falsified by certain trivial examples, making the ""disagreed examples"" not as meaningful.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

4656,The main focus has been to develop an estimator that can reliably work with small dataset sizes.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4657,They first reduce the sample complexity of estimating mutual information by decoupling the network learning problem and the estimation problem by creating a training and validation set and then using the validation set for estimating mutual information.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

4660,I am inclined to accept (weak) the paper for the following reasons:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4661,1. The paper uses some nice ideas to reduce the variance of the MI estimates and to be able to work with smaller dataset sizes.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4662,Both splitting data into training and validation and then using task augmentation to make learning robust are pretty nice ideas.,fine,none,9.0,9,9

4682,This paper introduces a simple measure of tunability that allows to compare optimizers under varying resource constraints.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4683,The tunability of the optimizer is a weighted sum of best performance at a given budget.,fine,none,9.0,8,9
4684,"The authors found that in a setting with low budget for hyperparameter tuning, tuning only Adam optimizer’s learning rate is likely to be a very good choice; it doesn’t guarantee the best possible performance, but it is evidently the easiest to find well-performing hyperparameter configurations.",fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8
4685,Comments:,fine,arg-structuring_heading,6.0,6,6
4686,The paper is easy to follow.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4687,"The motivation of defining tunability of optimizer is a very interesting question, however, the study seems to preliminary and the conclusion is not quite convencing due to several reasons:",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4688,"In section 3.2, to characterize its difficulties of finding best hyperparameters or tunability, the authors seem to try to connect the concept of “sharpness” of a minima in loss surface to the tunability of an optimizer, which is similar to comparing the loss landscape of minimums.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

4690,"Can the author be more specific about the x-axis in the illustration 1.a and 1.b? If I understand correctly, they are not the number of trails.",fine,arg-request_explanation,3.0,3,3
4691,"In addition, the proposed stability metric seems not quite related with the above intuitions, as the illustrations (1.a and 1b) define the tunability to be the flatness of hyperparameter space around the best configurations, but the proposed definition is a weighted sum of the incumbents in terms of the HPO budgets.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4692,"The definition of the tuning budgets is not clear, is it the number of trials or the time/computation budgets?",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4693,"The authors seems interchangeably using “runs” and “iterations”, which makes the concept more confusable.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4694,The authors further proposed three weighting schemes to emphasize the tunability of different stage of HPO.,fine,arg-structuring_summary,8.0,8,8

4696,"For instance, in case of grid search HPO and 0.1 is the best learning rate, different search order such as [10, 1, 0.01, 0.1] and [0.1, 0.01, 1, 10] could results in dramatic different CPE and CPL.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4697,My major concern is the hyperparameter distributions for each optimizer highly requires prior knowledge.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4698,"A good prior of one optimizer could significantly affect the HPO cost or increase the tunability, i.e., the better understanding the optimizer, the less tuning cost.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4699,"My major concern is that the authors assume the hyperparameters to be independent (section 3.2), which is not necessarily true.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4700,"Actually hyperparameters are highly correlated, such as momentum, batch size and learning rate are correlated in terms of effective learning rate [1,2], so as weight decay and learning rate are [3], which means using non-zero momentum is equivalent to using large learning rate as long as the effective learning rate is the same.",fine,none,9.0,9,9
4701,This could significantly increase the tunability of SGDM.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4702,Another concurrent submission [4] verified this equivalence and showed one can also just tune learning rate for SGDM.,fine,none,9.0,9,9
4703,"The assumption of independent hyperparameters might be fine for black box optimization or with the assumption that practitioners have no knowledge of the importance of each hyperparameter, then the tunability of the optimizer could be different based on the prior knowledge of hyperparameter and their correlations. But it is not rigorous enough to make the conclusion that Adam is easier to tune than SGD.",fine,none,9.0,9,9

Since the actor-critic model is the novel component in this model (propagating gradients through the learned dynamics), I would like to see additional analysis and baseline comparisons of this method to previous actor-critic policy learning methods, such as DDPG and SAC training on the (fixed) latent state representations, and recent work of MVE or STEVE that use the learned dynamics to accelerate policy learning with multi-step updates.",fine,arg-request_experiment,2.0,2,2
