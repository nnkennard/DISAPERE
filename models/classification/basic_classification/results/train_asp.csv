93,"There are many typos and mistakes (e.g., the last paragraph of the paper starts with a sentence that does not make any sense), missing references (e.g., there is an empty parenthesis at the end of the second paragraph on the second page) and in at least two cases, there are references to a formula that is not in the manuscript (e.g., reference to formula 15 on line 3 of page 5).",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1

228,The paper proposed variational selective autoencoders (VSAE) to learn from partially-observed multimodal data.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
229,"Overall, the proposed method is elegant; however, the presentation, the claim, and the experiments suffer from significant flaws.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
230,See below for detailed comments.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
231,[Pros],asp,none,8.0,8,8
232,1. The main idea of the paper is to propose a generative model that can handle partially-observed multimodal data during training.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
233,"Specifically, prior work considered non-missing data during training, while we can't always guarantee that all the modalities are available.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
234,"Especially in the field of multimodal learning, we often face the issue of imperfect sensors.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
235,This line of work should be encouraged.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
236,"2. In my opinion, the idea is elegant.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,4,3
237,The way the author handles the missingness is by introducing an auxiliary binary random variable (the mask) for it.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
238,"Nevertheless, its presentation and Figure 1 makes this elegant idea seems over-complicated.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
239,[Cons],asp,none,8.0,8,8
240,1. [The claim] One of my concerns for this paper is the assumption of the factorized latent variables from multimodal data.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
241,"Specifically, the author mentioned Tsai et al. assumed factorized latent variables from the multimodal data, while Tsai et al. actually assumed the generation of multimodal data consists of disentangled modality-specific and multimodal factors.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
242,"It seems to me; the author assumed data from one modality is generated by all the latent factors (see Eq. (11)), then what is the point for assuming the prior of the latent factor is factorized (see Eq. (4) and (5))?",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
243,"One possible explanation is because we want to handle the partially-observable issues from multimodal data, and it would be easier to make the latent factors factorized (see Eq. (6)).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
244,The author should comment on this.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,2,6
245,2. [Phrasing.] There are too many unconcise or informal phrases in the paper.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
246,"For example, I don't understand what does it mean in ""However, if training data is complete, ..... handle during missing data during test."" Another example would be the last few paragraphs on page 4; they are very unclear.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
247,"Also, the author should avoid using the word ""simply"" too often (see the last few paragraphs on page 5).",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
248,3. [Presentation.] The presentation is undesirable. It may make the readers hard to follow the paper.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
249,I list some instances here.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
250,"a. In Eq. (3), it surprises me to see the symbol \epsilon without any explanation.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

252,"The author should also add more explanation here,",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
253,since Eq. (6)  stands a crucial role in the author's method.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

262,The author should explain this.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6
263,"h. Generally speaking, the paper does require a significant effort to polish Section 3 and 4.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
264,"4. [Experiments.] The author presented a multimodal representation learning framework for partially-observable multimodal data, while the experiments cannot corraborrate the claim.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

267,"These synthetic setting can be used for sanity check, but cannot be the main part of the experiments.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
268,"The author can perhaps consider the datasets used by Tsai et al. There are seven datasets, and they can all be modified to the setting of partially-observable multimodal data.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,2,7
269,"Also, since the synthetic image pairs are not multimodal in nature, it is unclear to me for what the messages are conveyed in Figure 3 and 4.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6
270,I do expect the paper be a strong submission after a significant effort in presentation and experimental designs.,asp,none,8.0,7,8
271,"Therefore, I vote for weak rejection at this moment.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
272,"The paper builds upon Deep Image Prior (DIP) - work which shows that one can optimize a neural generator to fit a single image without learning on any dataset, and the output of the generator (which approximates the image) can be used for denoising / super resolution / etc.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
273,"The paper proposes a new architecture for the DIP method which has much less parameters, but works on par with DIP.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
274,Another contribution of the paper is theoretical treatment of (a simplified version of) the proposed architecture showing that it can’t fit random noise (and thus maybe better suited for denoising).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
275,"The paper is clearly written, and the proposed architecture has too cool properties: it’s compact enough to be used for image compression; and it doesn’t overfit thus making early stopping notnesesary (which was crucial for the original DIP model).",asp,asp_originality,4.0,1,4
276,I have two main concerns about this paper.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
277,"First, it is somewhat misleading about its contributions: it's not obvious from abstract/introduction that the whole model is the same as DIP except for the proposed architecture.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
278,"Specifically, the first contribution listed in the introduction makes it look like this paper introduces the idea of not learning the decoder on the dataset (the one that starts with “The network is not learned and itself incorporates all assumptions on the data.”).",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,8,1
279,My second concern is about the theoretical contribution.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
280,"On the one hand, I enjoyed the angle the authors tackled proving that the network architecture is underparameterized enough to be a good model for denoising.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
281,"On the other hand, the obtained results are very weak: only one layered version of the paper is analysed and the theorem applies only to networks with less than some threshold of parameters.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
282,"Roughly, the theorem states that if for example we fix any matrix B of size e.g. 256 x k and matrix U of size 512 x 256 and then compute U relu(B C) where C is the vector of parameters of size k x 1, AND if k < 2.5 (i.e. if we use at most 2 parameters), then it would be very hard to fit 512 iid gaussian values (i.e. min_C ||U relu(B C) - eta|| where eta ~ N(0, 1)).",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
283,"This restriction of the number of parameters to be small is only mentioned in the theorem itself, not in the discussion of its implications.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
284,"Also, the theorem only applies to the iid noise, while most natural noise patterns have structure (e.g. JPEG artifacts, broken pixels, etc) and thus can probably be better approximated with deep models.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
285,"Since the paper manages to use very few parameters (BTW, how many parameters in total do you have? Can you please add this number to the text?), it would be cool to see if second order methods like LBFGS can be applied here.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
286,Some less important points:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
287,Fig 4 is very confusing.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
288,"First, it doesn’t label the X axis.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
289,"Second, the caption mentions that early stopping is beneficial for the proposed method, but I can’t see it from the figure.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
290,"Third, I don’t get what is plotted on different subplots.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
291,"The text mentions that (a) is fitting the noisy image, (b) is fitting the noiseless image, and (c) is fitting noise. Is it all done independently with three different models?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
292,"Then why does the figure says test and train loss? And why DIP loss goes up, it should be able to fit anything, right? If not and it’s a single model that gets fitted on the noisy image and tested on the noiseless image, then how can you estimate the level of noise fitting? ||G(C) - eta|| should be high if G(C) ~= x.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
293,"Also, in this quote “In Fig. 4(a) we plot the Mean Squared Error (MSE) over the number of iterations of the optimizer for fitting the noisy astronaut image x + η (i.e., FORMULA ...” the formula doesn’t correspond to the text.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
294,"And finally, the discussion of this figure makes claims about the behaviour of the model that seems to be too strong to be based on a single image experiment.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
295,I don’t get the details of the batch normalization used: with respect to which axis the mean and variance are computed?,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
296,The authors claim that the model is not convolutional.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
297,"But first, it’s not obvious why this would be a good thing (or a bad thing for that matter)",asp,asp_substance,7.0,1,7
298,.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
299,"Second, it’s not exactly correct (as noted in the paper itself): the architecture uses 1x1 convolutions and upsampling, which combined give a weak and underparametrized analog of convolutions.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
300,"> The deep decoder is a deep image model G: R N → R n, where N is the number of parameters of the model, and n is the output dimension, which is typically much larger than the number of parameters (N << n).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
301,"I think it should be vice versa, N >> n",asp,arg_other,0.0,1,0
302,The following footnote,asp,none,8.0,8,8

304,Uses unintroduced (at that point) notation and is very confusing.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
305,"It would be nice to have a version of Figure 6 with k = 6, so that one can see all feature maps (in contrast to a subset of them).",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,7,1
306,"I’m also wondering, is it harder to optimize the proposed architecture compared to DIP?",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
307,The literature on distillation indicates that overparameterization can be beneficial for convergence and final performance.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
308,*Summary*,asp,none,8.0,8,8
309,This paper study the convergence of Hamiltonian gradient descent (HGD) on minmax games.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
310,The paper show that under some assumption on the cost function of the min max that are (in some sense) weaker than strong convex-concavity.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
311,"More precisely, they use the ‘bilinearity’ of the objective (due to the interaction between the players) to prove that the squared norm of the vector field of the game follows some Polyak Lojasiewicz condition.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
312,Thus the proof is concluded by the linear (resp. sublinear) convergence of gradient descent (resp. stochastic GD) under PL assumption.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
313,*Decision*,asp,none,8.0,8,8
314,I think that is work is clearly very interesting.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
315,The fact to prove linear convergence rate without strong-convex-concavity is quite surprising. And this paper brings nice tools to analyse HGD.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
316,Also the result on Stochastic HGD is very interesting.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
317,"However, I am wondering whether this paper is perfectly suited to ICLR conference due to the lack of experiment, practical implication given by the theory, or theory in the non-convex setting (I know that the latter is a huge open question and I am not criticizing the absence of theory in the non-convex-concave setting).",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
318,One way to improve to work would be to provide practical takeaways from the theory or to provide experiments in the main paper.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

345,I tend to reject this paper because (1) the first contribution of the paper is not new as it has already been recognized by a few paper that SGD exhibits two different regimes; (2) this paper makes the debate of large-batch training even muddier.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
346,Main argument:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
347,The paper does not do a great job in clarify the debate.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3

448,The authors also provide extensive supplementary material (around 20 pages) with detailed derivations and descriptions of experiments.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

466,Summary of the paper:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
467,The paper has two intertwined goals.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
468,These goals are to illuminate the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
469,generalization/memorization properties of large and deep ConvNets in,asp,none,8.0,8,8
470,tandem with trying to develop procedures related to identifying,asp,none,8.0,8,8
471,whether an input to a trained ConvNet has actually been used to train the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
472,network.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
473,The latter task is generalized to detecting if a,asp,none,8.0,8,8
474,particular dataset has been used to train a ConvNet.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
475,These goal are,asp,none,8.0,8,8
476,tackled empirically with multiple sets of experiments on largescale,asp,none,8.0,8,8
477,datasets such as ImageNet22k and modern deep ConvNets architectures,asp,none,8.0,8,8
478,such as VGG and ResNet.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
479,Paper's positive points,asp,none,8.0,8,8
480,+ The paper has a very comprehensive set of references in the areas it,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
481,touches upon.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
482,+ Some of the experimental results presented are quite,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
483,interesting. They show that regularization data-augmentation helps,asp,none,8.0,8,8
484,prevent a network from explicit memorization and could be used as a,asp,none,8.0,8,8
485,way to help make training data more anonymous.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
486,+ Large scale experiments are reported on modern architectures.,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,7,5
487,Paper's negative points,asp,none,8.0,8,8
488,- The paper makes use of a result from the David MacKay textbook,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
489,which defines the capacity of a single layer network to memorize the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
490,labelling of $n$ inputs in $d$-dimensional space.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
491,If I'm not,asp,none,8.0,8,8
492,"mistaken, from this result the authors extrapolate that the capacity",asp,none,8.0,8,8
493,of a (deep) neural network,asp,none,8.0,8,8
494,is proportional to the number of,asp,none,8.0,8,8
495,parameters in the network.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
496,"This is true, but there are a",asp,none,8.0,8,8
497,couple of caveats.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
498,The first is that the coefficient of,asp,none,8.0,8,8
499,proportionality must depend very much on the number of layers in the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
500,network.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
501,Increasing the network's depth increases the efficiency of,asp,none,8.0,8,8
502,the representation (i.e. fewer total parameters needed to have the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
503,same representational power as a shallow network). And as MacKay,asp,none,8.0,8,8
504,also says in his book (chapter 44 quoting findings from Radford,asp,none,8.0,8,8
505,Neal) that for MLPs what determines the complexity of the typical,asp,none,8.0,8,8
506,function (once the network has a large enough width) represented by,asp,none,8.0,8,8
507,"the MLP is the ""characteristic magnitude of the weights"". So the",asp,none,8.0,8,8
508,regularization technique applied is very significant in the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
509,controlling the effective capacity of a network.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
510,This paper,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,8,5
511,experimentally shows that is the case multiple times as it is shown,asp,none,8.0,8,8
512,"that with increasing degrees of regularization (figure 1, figure 2)",asp,none,8.0,8,8
513,it becomes harder and harder to memorize the positive training,asp,none,8.0,8,8
514,images. It would be great if the paper also made some attempt to,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
515,consider these connections. Or at least comment on how these factors,asp,none,8.0,8,8
516,could be incorporated into a more sophisticated analysis of the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
517,capacity of a network.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
518,- There is a slight oxymoron in the premise of the first set of,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
519,experiments.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
520,The network is forced to memorize a set of,asp,none,8.0,8,8
521,positive examples relative to the negative set it sees during,asp,none,8.0,8,8
522,training. What is memorized I presume depends a lot on the negative,asp,none,8.0,8,8
523,"set used for training (its diversity, closeness to the positive set",asp,none,8.0,8,8
524,and how frequently each negative example is seen during,asp,none,8.0,8,8
525,training).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
526,This issue is not really commented upon in the paper. Is,asp,asp_substance,7.0,1,7
527,there a training task which would allow one to more explicitly,asp,none,8.0,8,8
528,memorize the image (some sort of reconstruction task) as opposed to,asp,none,8.0,8,8
529,an in/out classification task?,asp,none,8.0,8,8
530,- This paper is a slightly difficult read - not because of the,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
531,language or the presentation of the material but more because there,asp,none,8.0,8,8
532,is not one main coherent argument or goal for the paper.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
533,This is,asp,none,8.0,8,8
534,"reflected in the ""Related work"" section where 4 different",asp,none,8.0,8,8
535,issues/tasks are referred to.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
536,Each one of these topics is worthy of,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
537,"a paper in itself, but this paper dips into each one and then",asp,none,8.0,8,8
538,swiftly moves onto the next one.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
539,For example in section 3 the paper,asp,none,8.0,8,8
540,explores if a network can be forced to explicitly memorize a set of,asp,none,8.0,8,8
541,images and how the size of this set is affected by the number of,asp,none,8.0,8,8
542,parameters in the network and data augmentation.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
543,High-level,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
544,conclusions are made: more parameters in the network implies more,asp,none,8.0,8,8
545,images can be memorized and data-augmentation makes explicit,asp,none,8.0,8,8
546,memorization more difficult. Then it is off to considering,asp,none,8.0,8,8
547,pre-trained networks and determining whether by analyzing,asp,none,8.0,8,8
548,the,asp,none,8.0,8,8
549,statistics of the responses at different layers one can decide if a,asp,none,8.0,8,8
550,set of images was used for training or not (or similar tasks).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
551,Yes,asp,none,8.0,8,8
552,the different sections are related but it is does not feel like they,asp,none,8.0,8,8
553,build upon each other to help form a clearer picture of memorization,asp,none,8.0,8,8
554,within neural networks.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
555,- The conclusions focus on the importance of section 3 and,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

557,"reflect the opinions of the author? If yes, would",asp,none,8.0,7,8

559,material presented in section 3 and filling this out with more,asp,none,8.0,8,8

676,significance of the proposed model.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
677,i) The proposed architecture is mainly adopted from the graph attention networks (Veličković,asp,none,8.0,8,8

679,and,asp,none,8.0,8,8

681,Such a simple,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
682,combination is a good attempt to incorporate both node features and edge features but the,asp,none,8.0,8,8

700,The paper proposes a way to pre-train quantized representations for speech.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
701,The approach proposed is a two-stage process: 1. train a quantized version of wav2vec [my understanding is that wav2vec is the same thing as CPC for Audio except for using a binary cross-entropy loss instead of InfoNCE softmax-cross entropy loss].,asp,none,8.0,8,8
702,the authors propose to use gumbel softmax / VQ codebook for the vector quantization.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
703,"2. once you have a discrete representation, you could train BERT (as if it were a seq of language tokens).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
704,this makes a lot of sense especially given that CPC / wav2vec recovers phonemes and quantizing the phonemes will recover a language-like version of the raw audio. And running BERT across those tokens will allow you to capture the dependencies at the phoneme level.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
705,"After pre-training, the authors use the learned representations for speech recognition.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
706,They compare this to using log-mel filterbanks.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
707,The results (WER / LER) is lower for the proposed pipeline compared to using dense wav2vec representation for n-gram and character LM.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
708,It also makes sense that BERT helps for the k-means (vq) setting since the number of codes is large.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

711,This paper explores maximally expressive linear layers for jointly exchangeable data and in doing so presents a surprisingly expressive model.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
712,I have given it a strong accept because the paper takes a very well-studied area (convolutions on graphs) and manages to find a far more expressive model (in terms of numbers of parameters) than what was previously known by carefully exploring the implications of the equivariance assumptions implied by graph data.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,3,7
713,"The result is particularly interesting because the same question was asked about exchangeable matrices (instead of *jointly* exchangeable matrices) by Hartford et al. [2018] which lead to a model with 4 bases instead of the 15 bases in this model, so the additional assumption of joint exchangeability (i.e. that any permutations applied to rows of a matrix must also be applied to columns - or equivalently, the indices of the rows and columns of a matrix refer to the same items / nodes) gives far more flexibility but without losing anything with respect to the Hartford et al result (because it can be recovered using a bipartite graph construction - described below).",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,3,2
714,So we have a case where an additional assumption is both useful (in that it allows for the definition of a more flexible model) and benign (because it doesn't prevent the layer from being used on the data explored in Hartford et al.).,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,6,2
715,I only have a couple of concerns:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
716,1 - I would have liked to see more discussion about why the two results differ to give readers intuition about where the extra flexibility comes from.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
717,The additional parameters of this paper come from having parameters associated with the diagonal (intuitively: self edges get treated differently to other edges) and having parameters for the transpose of the matrix (intuitively: incoming edges are different to outgoing edges).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
718,Neither of these assumptions apply in the exchangeable setting (where the matrix may not be square so the diagonal and transpose can't be used).,asp,arg_other,0.0,6,0
719,"Because these differences aren't explained, the synthetic tasks in the experimental section make this approach look artificially good in comparison to Hartford et al.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2
720,"The tasks are explicitly designed to exploit these additional parameters - so framing the synthetic experiments as, ""here are some simple functions for which we would need the additional parameters that we define"" makes sense; but arguing that Hartford et al. ""fail approximating rather simple functions"" (page 7) is misleading because the functions are precisely the functions on which you would expect Hartford et al. to fail (because it's designed for a different setting).",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,6,2
721,"2 - Those more familiar of the graph convolution literature will be more familiar with GCN [kipf et al. 2016] / GraphSAGE [Hamilton et al. 2017] / Monti et al [2017] / etc..

722,I would have also liked to see a comparison to these methods in the the classification results.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2

724,"This is the case when you map an exchangeable matrix into a jointly exchangeable matrix by representing it as a bipartite graph [0, X; X^T, 0].",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,8,2
725,So the two results coincide for the exchangeable case. Might be worth pointing this out.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2

952,Strengths:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
953,- motivation: the natural extension of previous work on differentiable plasticity based on existing knowledge from neuro science is an important next step,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
954,- cue reward experiment exemplifies limitations of current plasticity approaches and clearly shows the potential benefits of neuro modulation,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
955,- maze navigation shows incremental benefits over non-modulated plasticity,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
956,- thorough experimentation,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
957,- clipping-trick is a neat observation,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
958,Weaknesses:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
959,"- evaluation: only on toy tasks (which includes PTB), no real world tasks",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,7,5
960,- very incremental improvements on PTB over a very simple baseline (far from SotA),asp,asp_replicability,5.0,4,5
961,- evaluated models (feed-forward NNs and LSTMs) are very basic and far from current SotA architectures,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
962,- no qualitative analysis on how modulation is actually use by the systems.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
963,"E.g., when is modulation strong and when is it not used",asp,none,8.0,8,8
964,Comments:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
965,"- perplexity improvements of less than 1.3 points over plasticity alone (which is the actual baseline for this paper) can hardy be called ""significant"". Even though they might be statistically significant (meaning nothing more than the two models being statistically different), minor architectural changes can lead to such improvements.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
966,"Furthermore PTB is not a ""challenging"" LM benchmark.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
967,Summary:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
968,This paper addresses the computational aspects of Viterbi-based encoding for neural networks.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
969,"In usual Viterbi codes, input messages are encoded via a convolution with a codeword, and then decoded using a trellis.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
970,"Now consider a codebook with n convolutional codes, of rate 1/k.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
971,Then a vector of length n is represented by inputing a message of length k and receiving n encoded bits.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
972,Then the memory footprint (in terms of messages) is reduced by rate k/n.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
973,"This is the format that will be used to encode the row indices in a matrix, with n columns.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
974,(The value of each nonzero is stored separately.),asp,none,8.0,8,8
975,"However, it is clear that not all messages are possible, only those in the ""range space"" of my codes. (This part is previous work Lee 2018.)",asp,none,8.0,8,8
976,"The ""Double Viterbi"" (new contribution) refers to the storage of the nonzero values themselves.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
977,"A weakness of CSR and CSC (carried over to the previous work) is that since each row may have a different number of nonzeros, then finding the value of any particular nonzero requires going through the list to find the right corresponding nonzero, a sequential task.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
978,"Instead, m new Viterbi decompressers are included, where each row becomes (s_1*codeword_1 + s_2*codeword2 + ...) cdot mask, and the new scalar are the results of the linear combinations of the codewords.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
979,Pros:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
980,"- I think the work addressed here is important, and though the details are hard to parse and the new contributions seemingly small, it is important enough for practical performance.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
981,- The idea is theoretically sound and interesting.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
982,Cons:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
983,- My biggest issue is that there is no clear evaluation of the runtime benefit of the second Viterbi decompressor.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
984,"Compressability is evaluated, but that was already present in the previous work.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,8,4
985,Therefore the novel contribution of this paper over Lee 2018 is not clearly outlined.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
986,- It is extremely hard to follow what exactly is going on; I believe a few illustrative examples would help make the paper much clearer; in fact the idea is not that abstract.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
987,"- Minor grammatical mistakes (missing ""a"" or ""the"" in front of some terms, suggest proofread.)",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
988,This paper is well set-up to target the interesting problem of degraded generalisation after adversarial training.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
989,"The proposal of applying spectral normalisation (SN) is well motivated, and is supported by margin-based bounds.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3

994,* The proposal looks theoretically solid,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
995,Cons:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
996,"* It is unclear to me whether the ""efficient method for SN in convolutional nets"" is more efficient than the power iteration algorithm employed in previous work, such as Miyato et al. 2018, which also used SN in conv nets with different strides.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
997,There is no direct comparison of performance.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
998,* Fig. 3 needs more explanation.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
999,"The horizontal axes are unlabelled, and ""margin normalization"" is confusing when shown together with SN without an explanation.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1000,Perhaps it's helpful to briefly introduce it in addition to citing Bartlett et al. 2017.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
1001,* The epsilons in Fig. 5 have very different scales (0 - 0.5 vs. 0 - 5). Are these relevant to the specific algorithms and why?,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1002,* Section 5.3 (Fig. 6) is the part most relevant to the generalisation problem.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1003,"However, the results are unconvincing: only the results for epsilon = 0.1 are shown, and even so the advantage is marginal.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1004,"Furthermore, the baseline models did not use other almost standard regularisation techniques (weight decay, dropout, batch-norm).",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2

1007,This paper proposes to address few-shot learning in a transductive way by learning a label propagation model in an end-to-end manner.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1008,Semi-supervised few-shot learning is important considering the limitation of the very few labeled instances.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1009,This is an interesting work.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
1010,The merits of this paper lie in the following aspects: (1) It is the first to learn label propagation for transductive few-shot learning.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,8,4
1011,(2) The proposed approach produced effective empirical results.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
1012,The drawbacks  of the work include the following: (1) There is not much technical contribution.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1013,It merely just puts the CNN representation learning and the label propagation together to perform end-to-end learning.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1014,"Considering the optimization problem involved in the learning process, it is hard to judge whether the effect of such a procedure from the optimization perspective.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1015,"(2) Empirically, it seems TPN achieved very small improvements over the very baseline label propagation.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1016,"Moreover, the performance reported in this paper seems to be much inferior to the state-of-the-art results reported in the literature.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1017,"For example,  on miniImageNet, TADAM(Oreshkin et al, 2018) reported 58.5 (1-shot) and 76.7(5-shot), which are way better than the results reported in this work.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1018,This is a major concern.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1019,Summary:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1020,"This paper makes an observation that most of the neural network architectures do not learn the mutual exclusivity (ME) bias: if an object has one label, then it does not need another.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1021,Authors demonstrate this in both synthetic tasks and real-world tasks like object recognition and machine translation.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1022,Authors argue that ME bias could help the model to handle new classes and rare events better.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1023,My comments:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1024,I very much enjoyed reading this paper.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1025,I support accepting this paper.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1026,It highlights one of the missing inductive biases in ML and proposes it as a challenge.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,8,3
1027,"As the authors also agree, ME bias is missing not just in DNNs.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1028,It is the issue of MLE.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1029,It would be good to have some non-NN results too.,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,7,5
1030,I see this is a challenge for MLE than DNNs.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1031,1. In figure-4 you mention that entropy regularizer helps to keep the initial ME score. Can you elaborate more about the way in which entropy regularizer is used with regular MLE training?,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1032,2. It is not very clear how is the base rate computed in Figure 5. I have a guess. But it is better to explain it in detail.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,1,7

1040,=====================================================,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1041,After rebuttal: I have read the authors' response and  I stand by my decision.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1042,"This paper explores self-supervised learning in the low-data regime, comparing results to self-supervised learning on larger datasets.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1043,"BiGAN, RotNet, and DeepCluster serve as the reference self-supervised methods.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1044,"It argues that early layers of a convolutional neural network can be effectively learned from a single source image, with data augmentation.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1045,"A performance gap exists for deeper layers, suggesting that larger datasets are required for self-supervised learning of useful filters in deeper network layers.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1046,I believe the primary claim of this paper is neither surprising nor novel.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
1047,"The long history of successful hand-designed descriptors in computer vision, such as SIFT [Lowe, 1999] and HOG [Dalal and Triggs, 2005], suggest that one can design (with no data at all) features reminiscent of those learned in the first couple layers of a convolutional neural network (local image gradients, followed by characterization of those gradients over larger local windows).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1048,"More importantly, it is already well established that it is possible to learn, from only a few images, filter sets that resemble the early layers of filters learned by CNNs.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1049,This paper fails to account for a vast amount of literature on modeling natural images that predates the post-AlexNet deep-learning era.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4

1078,"The paper not only claims 'large scale representation learning' but also utilizing the described idea to use neural networks to ""directly, approximately solve non-convex NP-hard optimization problems that arise naturally in unsupervised learning problems.""

1079,As such the paper is not convincing.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,4,3
1080,On a more detailed level it is not clear why the log n representation for items is choosen -- why not just map to embeddings directly?,asp,none,8.0,1,8
1081,"The more interesting question of how to generalize to unseen items (how would that be possible given that items have no representation at all) is not discussed at all and seems not to be realizable, which makes the starting point of such methods (items have no representation) questionable.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

1090,"Nevertheless, this paper clearly explores and offers a novel approach for more efficient on-policy exploration which allows for more stable learning compared to traditional approaches.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4

1100,"This seems a much more natural approach to me, and I'm surprised that you did not start with that.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

1107,"5. To train \sigma and \omega, the negative instances are selected randomly.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1108,You mention that negative mining should improve over this strategy. What does negative mining correspond to in this context? Are there bad rewrites better than others?,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
1109,"6. Did you consider using an inverse function (say G), that maps an embedding in L / L' back to S (i.e. the inverse function of gamma / gamma').",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1110,"I would imagine that even if an embedding X is a bit noisy, because not exactly equal to gamma(P) where P is the expression it represents, you could consider doing the propagation with gamma(G(X)).",asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
1111,This could be a possibility to remove the noise you have when doing multi-step operations (and potentially go way beyond 4 steps).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1112,"Also, G could be used to check whether you obtain the expected formula after 4 steps, which would be a more informative information than the L2 distance between the resulting embedding and the embedding of the final formula.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1113,"Overall, the model is a bit complicated (e.g. question 1.), but the results are promising, the paper is well written, and the ability to manipulate formula embeddings is probably going to be useful in the context of theorem proving.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1114,This paper studies the dynamics-based curiosity intrinsic reward where the agent is rewarded highly in states where the forward dynamic prediction errors are high in an embedding space (either due to complexity of the state or unfamiliarity).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1115,"Overall I like the paper, it's systematic and follows a series of practical considerations and step-by-step experimentations.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1116,One of the main area which is missing in the paper is the comparison to two other class of RL methods: count-based exploration and novelty search.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
1117,"While the section 4 has a discussion on related papers, there's no systematic experimental comparison across these methods.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
1118,"In sec. 4, there's a reference to an initial set of experiments with count-based methods without much details.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1119,Another area of improvement is the experiments around VAE.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1120,"While the paper shows experimentally that they aren't as successful as the RFs or IDFs, there's no further discussion on the reasons for poor performance.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
1121,Also it's not clear from the details in the paper what are the architectures for the VAE and RFs (there's a reference to the code but would've been better to have sufficient details in the paper).,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1122,An interesting area for future work could be on early stopping techniques for embedding training - it seems that RFs perform well without any training while in some scenarios the IDFs work overall the best.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
1123,So it would be interesting to explore how much training is needed for the embedding model.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
1124,RFs are never trained and IDFs are continuously trained.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1125,So maybe somewhere in between could be the sweet spot with training for a short while and then fixing the features.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1126,"This paper proposes two new architectures for processing set-structured data: An RNN with an accumulator on its output, and an RNN with gating followed by an accumulator on its output.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1128,"Additionally, I believe the experimental tasks are new, and as a result all implementations of competing techniques are by the paper authors. This makes it difficult to have confidence in the higher reported performance of the proposed techniques.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,4,2
1129,Algorithms for Streaming data using a machine learning oracle is analyzed theoretically and empirically.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1130,The idea is to build on some recent work (Hsu 19) which used RNNs to predict heavy hitters in streaming data.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1131,The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether such an oracle can help streaming algorithms to obtain improved bounds.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,8,3
1132,I am not very familiar with this line of research so my comments will be more general in this case.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1133,The idea of improved bounds for streaming algorithms using machine learning oracle seems to be very appealing to me.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,3,4
1134,The authors present novel theoretical results supporting this.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
1135,Experiments are performed on real as well as synthetic datasets using Hsu et al.’s method as an oracle.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7

1137,"Overall, I think the paper seems to be  an interesting direction which has both formal guarantees and experiments validating them in real-world datasets.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3

1321,"- impact: the results achieved in the experiments are very small improvements compared to the baseline of RGCN (~ +0.01 in two experiments and ~ -0.04 in another) and often these small variations in results can be compensated with better baselines training (e.g. better hyper-params, ...)",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1322,"However, on a positive note, the paper has been written very well and I really liked the frank discussion on page 8 about results on MUTAG dataset.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1323,This paper proposes a self-auxiliary-training method that aims to improve the generalization performance of simple supervised learning.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

1325,"During training, the classification network and the generator network are alternatively updated, and the update of the latter aims to maximize the improvement of the former after using the generated auxiliary label for training.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1326,The method requires a class hierarchy in advance to define the binary mask applied to the output layer for auxiliary class prediction.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1327,A KL divergence term is attached to the optimization objective to avoid generating trivial and collapsing auxiliary classes.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1328,Pros:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1329,1) The main idea is simple and easy to understand.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1

1331,3) Uses several visualizations to show experimental results.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1332,Cons:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1333,"1) The problem it aims to solve is neither multi-task learning nor meta-learning: it tries to solve a supervised classification problem defined on principle classes, with the help of simultaneously predicting/generating auxiliary class labels.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1334,"Although the concept of ""task"" is not explicitly defined in this paper, the authors seem to associate each task with a specific class.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
1335,"This is not correct: in meta-learning, each task is a subset of classes drawn from a ground set of classes, and different tasks are independently sampled.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1336,"In addition, the classification models for different tasks are independent, though their training might be related by a meta-learner.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1337,"Hence, the claims in multiple places of this paper and the names for the two networks are misleading.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1338,"2) At the end of Page 4, the authors show that the update of the generator only depends on the improvement of the classifier after using the auxiliary label for training.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1339,"In fact, the optimal auxiliary labels minimizing the objective is the ground truth label for principle classes.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1340,This results in the class collapsing problem observed by the authors.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1341,"The KL divergence regularization introduces extra randomness to the auxiliary labels and thus mitigates the problem, but it hardly provides any useful information except randomness.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
1342,"In other words, the auxiliary labels for a specific principle class are very possible to be multiple noisy copies of the principal label with random perturbations.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1343,So it is not convincing to me that the auxiliary labels generated by the generator can be really helpful.,asp,none,8.0,7,8
1344,"My conjecture is that the observed improvements are mainly due to the softness of the auxiliary labels, which has been proved by model compression/knowledge distillation and recent ""born-again neural networks"".",asp,none,8.0,8,8

Moreover, since the method is not a meta-learning approach for few-shot learning, it is not fair and also not appropriate to compare with Prototypical Network.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1350,"4) Although the paper claims that the ground truth fine labels are not required, it requires a class hierarchy, which in the experiments are provided by the dataset and defined between true coarse and fine classes.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1351,"In practice, such hierarchy might be much harder to achieve than the primary (coarse) labels, and might be as costly to obtain as the true fine-class labels.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
1352,This weakens the feasibility of the proposed method.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1353,"5) The experiments only test the proposed method on CIFAR100 and CIFAR10, which has at most 100 fine classes.",asp,none,8.0,7,8

1412,It is easy to follow and contains a lot of empirical results.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1413,"Thanks for the results, but I have several questions.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1414,"First, In Theorem 2, which seems to be a main result of the paper, the authors were concerned with the condition when W_{ji} >0, but there is not conclusion if W_{ji} =0.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1415,"In order to correctly estimate causal relations from data, both cases must be considered.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1416,"Second, the conclusion of Theorem 2 seems to be flawed.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1417,Let me try to make it clear with the following example.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1418,"Suppose x^1_{t-2} directly causes x^2_{t-1} and that x^2_{t-1} directly causes x^3_{t}, without a direct influence from x^1_{t-2}  to x^3_{t}. Then when minimizing (2), we have the following results step by step:",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1419,"1) The noise standard deviation in x^2_{t-1}, denoted by \eta_2, may be non-zero.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1420,"This is because we minimize a tradeoff of the prediction error (the first term in (2)) and a function of the reciprocal of the noise standard deviation \eta_2 (the second term in (2)), not only the prediction error.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1421,"2) If \eta_2 is non-zero, then x^1_{t-2} will be useful for the purpose of predicting x^3_{t}. (Note that if \eta_2 is zero, then x^1_{t-2} is not useful for predicting x^3_{t).) From the d-separation perspective, this is because x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not d-separated by x^2_{t-1} + \eta_2 \cdot \epsilon_2, although they are d-separated by x^2_{t-1}. Then the causal Markov condition tells use that x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not independent conditional on x^2_{t-1} + \eta_2 \cdot \epsilon_2, which means that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1422,"3) Given that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}, when (2) is minimized, \eta_1 will not go to infinity, resulting in a non-zero W_{13), which *mistakenly* tells us that X^{1}_{t-1} directly structurally causes x^{(3)}_t.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1423,This illustrates that the conclusion of Theorem 2 may be wrong.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1424,I believe this is because the proof of Theorem 2 is flawed in lines 5-6 on Page 16.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1425,It does not seem sensible to drop X^{j}_{t-1} + \eta_X \cdot \epsilon_X and attain a smaller value of the cost function at the same time.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
1426,"Please carefully check it, especially the argument given in lines 10-13.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1427,"Third, it is rather surprising that the authors didn't mention anything about the traditional causal discovery methods based on conditional independence relations in the data, known as constraint-based methods, such as the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 1993), IC algorithm (Pearl, 2000), and FCI (Spirtes et al., 1993).",asp,asp_substance,7.0,1,7
1428,Such methods are directly applicable to time-delayed causal relations by further considering the constraint that effects temporally follow the causes.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1429,"Fourth, please make it clear that the proposed method aims to estimate ""causality-in-mean"" because of the formulation in terms of regression.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1430,"For instance, if x^j_{t-1} influences only the variance of x^i_{t}, but not its mean, then the proposed method may not detect such a causal influence, although the constraint-based methods can.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1436,"Specifically, it proposes a specific Boltzmann machine to be used as a first layer of neural networks for MNIST classification.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1438,This pre-trained model is then incorporated into the neural net for MNIST classification.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

1541,I don't think Cakewalk is different enough from the cross-entropy method to warrant acceptance in ICLR.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
1542,"I also have concerns about the independence assumption in their sampling distribution (Section 3.2), and the fact that their experiments use the same set of (untuned) hyperparameters for each method.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

1545,## Specific Comments and Questions ##,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1546,1. Cakewalk is *very* closely related to the cross-entropy method.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1547,"The authors acknowledge this connection, but I think they should begin by introducing CE and then explain how Cakewalk generalizes it.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2

1549,"The difference is that Cakewalk uses the CDF directly, while CE uses a threshold function on the CDF.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1550,2. The distribution proposed in section 3.2 assumes independence between the elements $x_j$. This seems problematic for some relatively simple problems.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1551,Consider $x$ a binary vector and reward equal to the parity $S(x) = \sum{x_j} % 2$.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1552,"3. In the experiments, there are large discrepancies between different optimizers on Cakewalk (e.g. SGA vs AdaGrad, Table 4).",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
1553,Is there any explanation for this?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1554,"4. How were the hyperparameters (learning rate, AdaGrad $\delta$, Adam $\beta_1, \beta_2$) chosen?",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
1555,"It seems like a large assumption that the same learning rate would work for different methods, especially when some of them are normalizing the objective function.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1556,I would suggest tuning these values for each method independently.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
1557,5. It would be nice to see experimental results on more than one problem.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1558,"The authors discuss their results on k-medoids in the appendices, but it seems like these results aren't quite complete yet.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

1560,"The reason for this is only given in a single sentence at the end of Section 6, so it is a little confusing.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6

1567,Pros:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1568,1.	Extensive analyses of the possibility of modeling posterior distributions with an INN have been shown.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1569,Detailed experiment setups are provided in the appendix.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1570,2.	The theoretical guarantee (with some assumptions) of the true posterior might be beneficial in practice for relatively low-dimensional or less complex tasks.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,8,3
1571,Comments/Questions:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1572,"1.	From the generative model point of view, could the authors elaborate on the comparison against cGAN (aside from the descriptions in Appendix 2)? It is quoted “cGAN…often lack satisfactory diversity in practice”.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2

1574,2.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,8,1
1575,"For the bidirectional training, did the ratios of the losses (L_z, L_y, L_x) have to be changed, or the iterations of forward/backward trainings have to be changed (e.g., 1 forward, 1 backward vs. 2 forward, 1 backward)?",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1576,"This question comes from my observation that the nature of the losses, especially for L_y vs. L_y,L_x (i.e., SL vs. USL) seem to be different.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1577,3.	“we find it advantageous to pad both the in- and output of the network with equal number of zeros”: Is this to effectively increase the intermediate network dimensions?,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1578,"Also, does this imply that for both forward and inverse process those zero-padded entries always come out to be zero?",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
1579,"It seems that there needs some way to enforce them to be zero to ensure that the propagation happens only among the entries belonging to the variables of interests (x, y and z).",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1582,Overview:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1583,This paper considers unsupervised (or self-supervised) discrete representation learning of speech using a combination of a recent vector quantized neural network discritization method and future time step prediction.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1584,Discrete representations are fine-tuned by using these as input to a BERT model; the resulting representations are then used instead of conventional speech features as the input to speech recognition models.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1585,New state-of-the-art results are achieved on two datasets.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1586,Strengths:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1587,The core strength of this paper is in the results that are achieved on standard speech recognition benchmarks.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
1588,"The results indicate that, while discritization in itself does not give improvements, coupling this with the BERT-objective results in speech features which are better in downstream speech recognition than standard features. I think the main technical novelty is in combining discritization with future time step prediction (but see the weakness below).",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
1589,Weaknesses:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1590,The main weakness of the paper is that it does not situate itself within existing literature in this area.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,4,2
1591,"Over the last few years, researchers in the speech community have invested significant effort in learning better speech representations, and this is not discussed.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2

1593,"Even more importantly, very recently there has been a number of papers investigating discrete representations of speech; see the review [2].",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1594,Some of these papers specifically use VQ-VAEs [3].,asp,none,8.0,8,8

1596,These studies should be mentioned.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
1597,This paper is different in that it incorporates future time step prediction.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1598,"But context prediction has also been considered before, also for speech [5, 6, 7].",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1599,This paper can be situated as a new contribution combining these two strands of research.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1600,In the longer run it would be extremely beneficial to the community if this approach is applied to the standard benchmarks as set out in [2].,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1601,"As a minor weakness, some parts of the paper is not described in enough detail and the motivation is weak or not exactly clear (see detailed comments below).",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,1,3
1602,Overall assessment:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1603,"I think the results as well as the new combination of existing approaches in the paper warrants publication. But it should be amended significantly to situate itself within the existing literature. I therefore award a ""weak accept"".",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2

1608,"- Section 4: Would it be possible to train the vq-wav2vec model jointly with BERT, i.e. as one model? I suspect it would be difficult since, for the masking objective, the discrete units are already required, but maybe there is a scheme where this could work.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,7,1
1609,"- Section 2.2: Similarly to the above question, would there be a way to incorporate the BERT principles directly into an end-to-end model, e.g. by randomly masking some of the continuous input speech?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,7,1
1610,"- Section 3.3: What exactly does ""mode collapse"" refer to in this context? Would this be using only one codebook entry, for instance?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1611,"- Section 6: It seems that in all cases to obtain improvements from discritization, BERT is required on top of the vq-wav2vec discrete symbols.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1612,Is it possible that the output acoustic model is simply better-matched to continuous rather than discrete input (direct vq-wav2vec gives discrete while BERT gives continuous)?

1727,"The paper proposes Dreamer, a model-based RL method for high-dimensional inputs such as images.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1728,The main novelty in Dreamer is to learn a policy function from latent representation-and-transition models in an end-to-end manner.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1729,"Specifically, Dreamer is an actor-critic method that learns an optimal policy by backpropagating re-parameterized gradients through a value function, a latent transition model, and a latent representation model.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1730,This is unlike existing methods which use model-free or planning methods on simulated trajectories to learn the optimal policy.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1731,"Meanwhile, Dreamer learns the remaining components, namely a value function, a latent transition model, and a latent representation model, based on existing methods (the world models and PlaNet).",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1788,"Via three different sets of experiments, the authors conclude that, under standard training procedures, neural networks in fact display an anti-ME bias: when faced with a novel input, they tend to assign less probability mass to unobserved outputs than is justified by the incoming data.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1789,The authors go on to argue that explicitly designing neural networks to reason by mutual exclusivity could lead to faster and more flexible learning.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1790,"While the experiments across several domains convincingly show the presence of an anti-ME bias in neural network training, I recommend that the paper be rejected because it falls short in demonstrating to what extent performance could be improved by correcting or reversing this bias.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1791,"The authors pose an interesting hypothesis, but it would gain a lot of credibility if they could provide an empirical analysis of an algorithm that uses ME reasoning to improve learning in a realistic setting or if they could at least perform some quantitative analysis of the effects of ME bias on task performance for a toy example.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
1792,Comments / questions:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1793,"* The authors duly acknowledge that ME bias is not necessarily desirable in all circumstances, namely in tasks that feature many-to-one mappings, citing polysemy and synonymy in machine translation as examples.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
1794,"Without an empirical example in a realistic setting, it is hard to judge whether the benefits of introducing an ME bias for better classification of new inputs belonging to new classes can outweigh the negatives via a potential increase in misclassification of those belonging to old classes.",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,7,5
1795,"* For the synthetic dataset one-to-one mapping of one-hot vectors it is clear that an ME bias would incur an advantage for classification on a zero-shot basis, i.e. an increased an accuracy for the first time a new input is observed. Is ME bias considered to be useful here because (i) we care directly about improving this type of zero-shot classification, or is it (ii) because it's implicitly assumed that a better initial prediction will lead to faster learning on these examples?",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
1796,*,asp,none,8.0,1,8
1797,"If it is (i) we care about, then it would be useful to quantify the advantage gained either empirically or analytically.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1798,It’s not obvious to me how useful the ME bias would be when there is a large number of classes since the probability assigned to the true novel class with a perfect ME bias would be 1 / (# unseen classes).,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
1799,"So at the beginning of training, while there are lots of new classes to benefit from the ME bias, the maximum advantage per example is small, and vice versa at the end of training - how do these conflicting effects balance each other out over the course of training and how do the benefits of ME bias scale with the number of classes?",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1800,"Presumably, whether the benefit scales well will depend on the loss function - in any case, this warrants some analysis/discussion especially given that there are no experiments to test it.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1801,"* The authors say that “ME can be generalized from applying to 'novel versus familiar’ stimuli to instead handling ‘rare versus frequent’ stimuli” and they cite the fact that neural networks take longer to learn from rare stimuli, suggesting that ME could help for reason (ii) above.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1802,It’s not obvious to me that ME bias will provide a significant advantage in a one-shot or few-shot learning setting - i.e. how useful is having made a better initial guess (which is random amongst the unseen classes) after you gain some specific information about the target class? Perhaps the benefit is small relative to that of the one-shot or few-shot information gained - I think this needs to be quantified empirically.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,1,7

1805,"From a strategic standpoint, in a scenario where it is difficult to determine whether a new image belongs to a new class or not, could it plausibly be more sensible for the network to make a strong prediction on its best guess out of previously seen classes (that it knows more about) rather than a scattered prediction on the unseen classes?",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1806,"Admittedly this is a difficult question to quantify, but my point is to question whether the anti-ME bias shown in Figure 6 is necessarily suboptimal, given the difficulty of classifying a new image as a new class or not.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1810,Summary:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1811,Many prior works have found that the features output by the final layer of neural networks can often be used as informative representations for many tasks despite being trained for one in particular.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1812,"These feature representations, however, are learned transformations of low-level input representations, e.g. RGB values of an image.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1813,"In this paper, they aim to learn useful feature representations without meaningful low-level input representations, e.g. just an instance ID.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1814,"Instead, meaningful representations are learned through gathered triplet comparisons of these IDs, e.g. is instance A more similar to instance B or instance C? Similar existing techniques fall in the realm of learning ordinal embeddings, but this technique demonstrates speed-ups that allow it to scale to large real world datasets.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1815,The two primary contributions of the paper are given as:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1816,- a showcase of the power of neural networks as a tool to approximately solve NP-hard optimization problems with discrete inputs,asp,none,8.0,8,8
1817,- a scalable approach for the ordinal embedding problem,asp,none,8.0,8,8

1828,"2. I think that the claim that the use of neural networks with discrete inputs can approximately solve NP-hard optimization problems is an exciting one, which likely necessitates more experiments (or theoretical results), but as it stands I don't think it is a fundamentally different conclusion from the fact that this method provides a great scalable solution for the ordinal embedding problem.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

1876,"Even for federated learning where the adversary can control multiple parties, such as [1], all parties still use the same global backdoor pattern to generate poisoning samples locally.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1877,"On the contrary, in this work, they decompose the global pattern into several small local patterns, and each adversarial party only uses a local pattern to generate poisoning samples.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1878,"In their evaluation, they show that the backdoor attacks generated in this way are more effective, resilient to benign model parameter updates, and also survive better against existing defense algorithms against attacks in federated learning settings.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1880,"Meanwhile, the evaluation is pretty comprehensive and it is good to see that the conducted backdoor attacks are effective.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

1883,"Specifically, I have the following questions for clarification:",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1884,"1. For the evaluation of DBA, I assume that there are 4 adversarial parties, controlling each of the 4 local triggers. When using centralized attacks, are there still 4 adversarial parties, although they share the same global trigger, or if there is only 1 adversarial party?",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,6,5
1885,"2. To evaluate A-S setting, I understand that it may be tricky to enable a fair comparison between the centralized attack and DBA.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1886,"However, one explanation of why DBA is more persistent in this case is because the adversarial parameter updates happen 4x times compared to the centralized attack.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1887,"Therefore, another baseline to check is to conduct centralized attacks with the same number of times as DBA, but each update includes 1/4 number of poisoning samples, so that the total number of poisoning samples included to compute the gradient update still stays the same.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

1913,"The most interesting one is the prediction of its dimensions by the CSLB features, which reveals a nice clustering in the different SPoSE dimensions.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
1914,Perhaps the results would be a little more convincing if additional common word embeddings were also tested.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1915,"Due to the different objects used in the different datasets, some of the experiments have a smaller set of words.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1916,A good extension of this work would be to combine a text-derived embedding  or the synsets to interpolate the SPoSE dimensions for missing words in the original set.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1917,Or perhaps the object similarity ratings could be used in a semi-supervised setting to inform the learning of a co-occurence word embedding.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
1918,This will allow the model to better describe a larger set of words.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7

1954,Authors conduct through numerical experiments highlighting how learning rate changes as a function of batch size (initially linear growth and then saturates).,asp,none,8.0,8,8

Since several previous works Kumar et al. (2017) and Qi et al.

2058,The conductance is the flow of attribution via the hidden unit(s) in consideration.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2059,The paper proposes using conductance to not only evaluate importance of hidden unit to the prediction for a specific input but also over a set of inputs.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2060,The strongest part of the analysis of conductance is that conductance naturally couples  the path at the base features with that of the hidden layer.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7

2071,"The authors claim that the proposed model can result in better uncertainty estimates and the experiments attempt to demonstrate the benefits of the approach, especially in cases of having to deal with adversarial attacks.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2072,The paper in general is well written and easy to follow.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2073,I have some concerns regarding the presentation of the main objective and the lack of justification in certain parts of the methodology.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2074,Let me elaborate.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2075,"First of all, I don’t understand how the main equation of the compound density network in Equation (3) is different from the general case of a Bayesian neural network? Can the authors please comment on that?",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
2076,I also find weird the way that the authors arrive to their final objective in Equation (5).,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
2077,They start from Equation (4) which is incorrectly denoted as the log-marginal distribution while it is the same conditional distribution introduced in Equation (3) with the extra summation for all the available data points.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2078,Then they continue to Equation (5) which they present as the combination of the true likelihood with a KL regularisation term.,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,8,5
2079,"However, what the authors implicitly did was to perform variational inference for maximising their likelihood by introducing a variational distribution q(\theta) = p(\theta | g(x_n; \psi).",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,8,5
2080,Is there a reason why the authors do not introduce their objective by following the variational framework?,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,6,5
2081,"Furthermore, in the beginning of Section 3.1 the authors present their idea on probabilistic hypernetoworks which “maps x to a distribution over parameters instead of specific value \theta.” How is this different from the case that we were considering so far? If we had a point estimate for \theta we would not require to take an expectation in Equation (3) in the first place.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2082,"My biggest concern in the methodology, however, has to do with the selection of the matrix variate normal prior for the weights and the imposition of diagonal covariances (diag(a) and diag(b)).",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,2,5
2083,"The Kronecker product between two diagonal matrices results in another diagonal matrix, i.e., diagonal covariance, which implies that the weights within a layer are given by an independent multivariate Gaussian.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2084,What is the purpose then for introducing the matrix variate Gaussian?,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
2085,I would expect that you would like to impose additional structure to the weights.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2086,I expect the authors to comment on that.,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,7,5
2087,Regarding the experimental evaluation of the model rather confusing.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2088,The authors have proposed a model that due to the mixing is better suited for predictions with heteroscedastic noise and can better quantify the aleatoric uncertainty.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2089,"However, the selected experiments on the cubic regression toy data (Section 5.1) and the out-of-distribution classification (Section 5.2) are clear examples of system’s noise, i.e. epistemic uncertainty.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2090,The generative process of the toy data clearly states that there is no heteroscedastic noise to handle.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2091,"The same applies for the notMNIST data which belong to a completely different data set compared to MNIST and thus out of sample prediction cannot benefit from the mixing; i.e., variations have to be explained by system’s noise.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2092,So overall I have the feeling that the authors have not succeeded to evaluate the model’s power with these two experiments and we cannot draw any strong conclusions regarding the benefit of the proposed mixing approach.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2093,"To continue with the experimental evaluation, I found the plots with the predictive uncertainty in Figure 3 a bit confusing.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2094,"The plot by itself, as I understood, quantifies the model’s uncertainty in in- and out-of sample prediction.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2095,"While I agree with the authors that it is generally desirable for a model to be more confident when predicting in MNIST (since it has already seen samples of it) compared to when predicting in notMNIST (completely different data), these plots tells us nothing regarding the predictive power of the model.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2096,"There is no value in being very confident if you are wrong and vice-versa, so unless there is an accompanying plot/table reporting the accuracy I see not much value from this plot alone.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2097,"Finally, it is unclear how the authors have picked the best \lambda parameter for their approach? On page 5 they state that they “pick the value that results in a good trade-off between high uncertainty estimates and high prediction accuracy.” Does this mean that you get to observe the performance in the test in order to select the appropriate value for \lambda? If this is the case this is completely undesirable and is considered a bad practice.",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
2098,Summary:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2099,This paper proposes a generative point cloud model based on adversarial learning and definitti’s representation theorem of exchangeable variables.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2100,"The main focus in experiments and the exposition is on 3D point clouds representing object shapes (seems the surface, but could also be the interior of objects, please clarify).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2101,"The main idea is to represent a point cloud using a global latent variable that captures the overall shape, and a collection of local latent variables that code for the position of a point on the shape.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2102,The model consists of thee components:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2103,"(i) an “encoder” that takes a point cloud as input and maps it to a (point estimate of) the global latent variable of the shape represented by the input cloud, a point-net architecture is used here",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2104,"(ii) a “decoder” that takes the estimated global latent variable, and a local latent variable, and maps it to an “output” point in the cloud to be produced by the model.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2105,"(iii) a “discriminator” network that aims to distinguish points from a *given* shape, and the points produced by pipe-lining the encoder and decoder.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2106,"Critically different from conventional GANs, the discriminator is optimized *per shape*, ie each point cloud is considered as a *distribution* over R^3 specific to that shape.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2107,"(iv) a “shape prior” that, once the encoder-decoder model from above is trained, is used to model the distribution over the global latent variables.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2108,"This model is trained, presumably, in a conventional GAN style using the global latent variable representations inferred across the different training point clouds.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2109,"As compared to prior work by Achiloptas et al (2017), the proposed approach has the advantage to allow for sampling an arbitrary number of points from the target shape, rather than a fixed pre-defined number.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2110,"In addition, the authors propose to minimize a weighted average of a lower bound and upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of points corresponding to given shapes.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2111,"This approach translates to improved quantitative evaluation measures,",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2112,"Experiments are conducted on a simple toy data set, as  a proof of concept, and on data from ModelNet10 and ModelNet40.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2113,Two performance metrics are introduced to assess the auto-encoding ability of the model: to what extent does the encoder-decoder pipeline result in point clouds similar to the shape from which the input point-cloud is generated.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2114,"Overall I find the idea of the paper interesting and worth publishing, but the exposition of the paper is less than ideal and needs further work.",asp,none,8.0,3,8

2560,"Maybe it's because of different scales? Previous works usually scale each pixel to [0,1] or [-1,1], maybe the authors use the [0, 255] scale? But 0.1/255 will be much smaller than 0.031.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

2593,[Summary]:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2594,This paper tackles the problem of automatic robot design.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2595,The most popular approach to doing this has been evolutionary methods which work by evolving morphology of agents in a feed-forward manner using a propagation and mutation rules.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2596,This is a non-differentiable process and relies on maintaining a large pool of candidates out of which best ones are chosen with the highest fitness.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2597,"In robot design for a given task using rewards, training each robot design using RL with rewards is an expensive process and not scalable.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2598,This paper uses graph network to train each morphology using RL.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2599,"Thereby, allowing the controller to share parameters and reuse information across generations.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2600,This expedites the score function evaluation improving the time complexity of the evolutionary process.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2601,[Strengths]:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2602,This paper shows some promise when graph network-based controllers augmented with evolutionary algorithms.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
2603,Paper is quite easy to follow.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2604,[Weaknesses and Clarifications]:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2605,=> Robot design area has been explored extensively in classical work of Sims (1994) etc. using ES.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2606,"Given that, the novelty of the paper is fairly incremental as it uses NerveNet to evaluate fitness and ES for the main design search.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2607,=> Environment: The experimental section of the paper can be further improved.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2608,"The approach is evaluated only in three cases: fish, walker, cheetah. Can it be applied to more complex morphologies? Humanoid etc. maybe?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,7,1
2609,=> Baselines: The comparison provided in the paper is weak.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2
2610,"At first, it compares to random graph search and ES.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2611,But there are better baselines possible.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2
2612,One such example would be to have a network for each body part and share parameters across each body part.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2613,"This network takes some identifying information (ID, shape etc.) about body part as input.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2614,"As more body parts are added, more such network modules can be added.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2615,How would the given graph network compare to this?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2616,This baseline can be thought of a shared parameter graph with no message passing.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2617,=> The results shown in Figure-4 (Section-4.2) seems unclear to me.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2618,"As far as I understand, the model starts with hand-engineered design and then finetuned using evolutionary process.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2619,"However, the original performance of the hand-engineered design is surprisingly bad (see first data point in any plot in Figure-4).",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2620,"Does the controller also start from scratch? If so, why? Also, it is not clear what is the meaning of generations if the graph is fixed, can't it be learned altogether at once?",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6
2621,[Recommendation]:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2622,I request the authors to address the comments raised above.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2623,"Overall, this is a reasonable paper but experimental section needs much more attention.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2624,"In this paper, the authors propose a method for dimensionality reduction of image data.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2625,They provide a structured and deterministic function G that maps a set of parameters C to an image X = G(C).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2626,"The number of parameters C is smaller than the number of free parameters in the image X, so this results in a predictive model that can be used for compression, denoising, inpainting, superresolution and other inverse problems.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2627,"The structure of G is as follows: starting with a small fixed, multichannel white noise image, linearly mix the channels, truncate the negative values to zero and upsample.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2628,This process is repeated multiple times and finally the output is squashed through a sigmoid function for the output to remain in the 0..1 range.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2629,"This approach makes sense and the model is indeed more principled than the one taken by Ulyanov et al. In fact, the DIP of Ulyanov et al. can hardly be considered ""a model"" (or a prior, for that matter), and instead should be considered ""an algorithm"", since it relies on the early stopping of a specific optimization algorithm.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2630,"This means that we are not interested in the minimum of the cost function associated to the model, which contradicts the very concept of ""cost function"".",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2631,"If only global optimizers were available, DIP wouldn't work, showing its value is in the interplay of the ""cost"" function and a specific optimization algorithm.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2632,None of these problems exist with the presented approach.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2633,The exposition is clear and the presented inverse problems as well as demonstrated performance are sufficient.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6
2634,One thing that I missed while reading the paper is more comment on negative results.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2635,"Did the authors tried any version of their model with convolutions or pooling and found it not to perform as well? Measuring the number of parameters when including pooling or convolutions can become tricky, was that part of the reason?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,6,1

2640,"The new model has been tested on the WebQuestionsSP and the WikiSQL datasets, with both automatic and human evaluation, compared to the baselines with copy and coverage mechanisms.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2641,Major points:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2642,"Overall, I think this paper is not good enough for an ICLR paper and the presentation is confusing in both its contributions and its technical novelty.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2643,"I don’t recommend to accept this paper, at least in the current format.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2644,"The paper states two major contributions (the last paragraph of Introduction), one is the new model Scratchpad Encoder, and the other is “possible to generate a large high quality (SPARQL query, local form) dataset”.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2645,"For the second contribution, there isn’t any evaluation/justification about the quality of the generated questions and how useful this dataset would be in any KB-QA applications.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2646,"I believe that this paper is not the first one to study question generation from logical form (cf. Guo et al, 2018 as cited), so it is unclear what is the contribution of this paper in that respect.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
2647,"For the modeling contribution, although it shows some improvements on the benchmarks and some nice analysis, the paper really doesn’t explain well the intuition of this “write” operation/Scratchpad (also the improvement of Scratchpad vs coverage is relatively limited). Is this something tailored to question generation? Why does it expect to improve on the question generation or it can improve any tasks which build on top of seq2seq+att framework (e.g., machine translation, summarization -- if some results can be shown on the most competitive benchmarks, that would be much more convincing)?",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
2648,In general I find Section 3 pretty difficult to follow.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1

2659,"They also extend this estimator to problems where the gradient should be ""backpropagated"" through a nested combination of random variables and a (non-linear) functions.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2660,Authors present an extensive experimental evaluation of the estimator on different challenging machine learning problems.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2661,"The paper addresses a relevant problem which appears in many machine learning settings, as it is the problem of estimating the gradient of an expectation-based objective.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
2662,"In general, the paper is well written and easy to follow. And the experimental evaluation is extensive and compares with relevant state-of-the-art methods.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2663,The main problem with this paper is that it is difficult to identify its main and novel contributions.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2664,"1. In the case of continuous random variables, Go-gradient is equal to Implicit Rep gradients (Figurnov et al. 2018) and pathwise gradients (Jankowiack & Obermeyer,2018).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2665,"Furthermore, for the Gaussian case, Implicit Rep gradients (and Go-gradient too) are equal to the standard reparametrization trick estimator (Kingma & Welling, 2014).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2666,This should be made crystal-clear in the paper.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,1,4
2667,What happens is that the authors arrive at this solution using a different approach.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2668,"In this sense, claims about the low-variance of GO-gradient wrt to other reparametrization baed estimators should be removed, as they are the same.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2669,"Moreover, I don't think some of the presented experiments are necessary.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2670,Simply because for continuous variables similar experiments have been reported before,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2671,"(Figurnov et al. 2018, Jankowiack & Obermeyer,2018).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2672,"2. It seems that the main novel contribution of the paper is to extend the ideas of (Figurnov et al. 2018, Jankowiack & Obermeyer,2018) to discrete variables. And this is a relevant contribution.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2673,And the experimental evaluations of this part are convincing and compare favourably with other state-of-the-art methods.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2674,3. Authors should be much more clear about which is their original contribution to the problems stated in Section 4 and Section 5.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4

2677,"<<Stochastic back-propagation (Rezende et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2015), focusing mainly on re-parameterizable Gaussian random variables and deep latent Gaussian models, exploits the product rule for an integral to derive gradient backpropagation through several continuous random variables.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2678,>>,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2679,This is exactly what authors do in these sections.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,3,4
2680,"Again it seems that the real contribution of this paper here is to extend this stochastic back-propagation (Rezende et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2015) ideas to discrete variables.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

2682,"Summarizing, the paper addresses a relevant problem but they do not state which their main contributions are, and reintroduce some ideas previously published in the literature.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2683,This paper builds a new graph convolutional network (GCN) based on hyperbolic representations of the graph nodes: all latent representations of the nodes are points on Poincare disks.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2684,The authors adapted the Hyperbolic Neural Networks by Ganea et al. (2018) into the Kipf & Welling's (2016) version of GCN.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2685,"Specifically, the authors variated the right matrix multiplication in GCN with Ganea et al.'s Mobius matrix-vector multiplication (that can be regarded as a transformation between two Poincare disks).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2686,"Moreover, as a non-trivial adaptation, the author defined the left matrix multiplication in GCN (that can be regarded as a weighted linear combination of several points on the same Poincare disk) with Ungar's (2010) weighted barycenter, which is from computational geometry but not the machine learning community.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2687,"The resulting method is tested on a toy problem and semi-supervised node classification of commonly used datasets, showing the possibility of improvement.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

2691,I vote for rejection for four major weaknesses explained as follows.,asp,arg_other,0.0,8,0
2692,(1) The experimental results cannot show the usefulness of the proposed GCN.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2693,The results on real datasets are similar to the regular GCN.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7

2695,"The experimental settings, e.g. how the train:test datasets are split, and hyperparameter settings, are not clearly given.",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
2696,(2) The method is not well motivated.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,7,3
2697,"The motivation, based on the writing, is that constant curvature spaces are more general where the computation is easy to handle.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2698,This is too general and not enough as a motivation.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
2699,"After reading, the reviewer cannot understand why the user should bother to use hyperbolic representations that are more complex to compute in GCNs, given that the experimental results are roughly the same.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
2700,(3) A large body of graph neural network literature is omitted.,asp,arg_other,0.0,2,0
2701,The authors start from a very high-level description of machine learning in constant curvature spaces.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2702,Such high-level introductions require more comprehensive literatures to support.,asp,arg_other,0.0,2,0
2703,"In the first mentioning of Graph Neural Networks, the authors only cited Kipf & Welling's GCN.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2704,This is misleading.,asp,arg_other,0.0,1,0
2705,"For example, the original GNN, ChebNet, etc. that leads to GCN can be mentioned.",asp,arg_other,0.0,2,0
2706,"The reviewer recommends the authors to read some literature review of the topic of GCN and re-organize the references, and use search engines to have a better view on the state of the art of (hyperbolic) geometric theories and graph convolutional networks.",asp,arg_other,0.0,2,0
2707,This is a thriving area that requires a careful literature review.,asp,arg_other,0.0,2,0
2708,(4) The writing quality is not satisfactory.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2709,Here are a few examples: The ICLR citation style needs to use sometimes \citep.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2710,"The authors instead used \cite everywhere, making the paper hard to read.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2711,The authors are suggested to use unified notations to denote vectors/matrices (e.g. all bold).,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2712,The introduction can start at a lower level (such as flat/hyperbolic neural networks).,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2713,"Section 3.4, as the main technical innovation, can be extended and includes some demonstrations.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2714,The authors propose to use the combination of model ensemble and MC dropout in Bayesian deep active learning.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2715,They empirically show that there exists the mode collapse problem due to the MC dropout which can be regarded as a variational approximation.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2716,The authors introduce an ensemble of MC-Dropout models with different initialization to remedy this mode collapse problem.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2717,The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2718,It is interesting to empirically show that the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout is important in active learning.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
2719,The major concern I have is that the ensemble of MC-Dropout models is not an approximation of the posterior anymore.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2720,"Each MC-Dropout model is an approximation of the posterior, but the ensemble of them may not.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2721,"Therefore, it is a little misleading to still call it Bayesian active learning.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2722,"Also, the ensemble of MC-Dropout models does not have the theoretic support from the Bayesian perspective.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2723,"The motivation for the proposed method is to solve the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout, but using ensemble loses the Bayesian support benefit of MC-Dropout.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2724,So it seems not a reasonable solution for the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2725,It is not clear to me why we need to add MC-Dropout to the ensemble.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6
2726,What is the benefit of DEBAL over an ensemble method if both of them do not have Bayesian theoretic support?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2727,"In terms of the empirical results, the better performance of DEBAL compared to a single MC-Dropout model is not supervising as Beluch et al. (2018) already demonstrated that an ensemble is better than a single MC-Dropout.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

2729,The labels of figures are hard to read.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2730,This paper proposed a general method for image restoration based on GAN.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2731,"In particular, the latent variable z is optimized based on the MAP framework.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2732,And the results are obtained by G(z).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2733,This method looks reasonable to achieve good results.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2734,"However, the idea is very related to Yeh et al.’s work which has already published but not mentioned at all.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2

2736,"Both the proposed method and Yeh et al.’s method optimize the latent variable z of the generator using MAP, although the loss functions are slightly different.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,7,4
2737,"In addition, the applications are very similar: image inpainting, denoising, super-resolution etc. Yeh et al.’s method should be the right baseline instead of the nearest neighbor algorithm.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
2738,"In addition, the results seem very weak.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2739,"There are tons of algorithms for image inpainting, denoising, and super-resolution, but the proposed method was not compared with them.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
2740,The paper claims that only the nearest neighbor algorithm can handle different degradations.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
2741,This is not true.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
2742,"For example, total variation regularization can do all these tasks.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2743,"Some other comments: what are the parameters of the degradation in the applications? For example, in image inpainting, does the proposed method learn the mask as well? So it is blind inpainting?",asp,asp_substance,7.0,1,7
2744,This paper proposes to relax the assumption of disentangled representation and encourage the model to learn linearly manipulable representations.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2745,The paper assumes that the latent canonicalizers are predefined for each task and that it is possible to obtain the ground-truth image of different latent canonicalizations.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2746,I find these assumptions too strong for the task of learning disentangled representation.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2747,"Firstly, most prior works such as beta-vae, info-gan do not assume that the factors / canonicalizers are known beforehand.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2748,"In fact, this is a very difficult part of learning disentangled representation.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2749,"Secondly, if it is possible to obtain the ground-truth image of different latent canonicalizations, you can simply train a network to predict the canonicalizations by simple supervised learning.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

2757,Summary:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2758,"The paper, considers methods for solving smooth unconstrained min-max optimization problems.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2759,"In particular, the authors prove that the Hamiltonian Gradient Descent (HGD) algorithm converges with linear convergence rate to the min-max solution.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2760,One of the main contributions of this work is that the proposed analysis is focusing on last iterate convergence guarantees for the HGD.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2761,"This result, as the authors claim can be particularly useful in the future for analyzing more general settings (nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2762,"In addition, two preliminary convergence theorems were provided for two extensions of HGD: (i) a stochastic variant of HGD and (ii)  Consensus Optimization Algorithm (CO) (by establishing connections of CO and HGD).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2763,Main Comments:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2764,The paper is well written and the main contributions are clear.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2765,"I believe that the idea of the paper is interesting and the convergence analysis seems correct, however i have some concerns regarding  the presentation and the combination of different assumptions used in the theory.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2766,1) I think definition 2.5 of Higher order Lipschitz is very strong assumption to have. What exactly means? Essentially the authors upper bounded any difficult term appear in the theorems. Is it possible to avoid having something so strong? Please elaborate.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2767,2) In assumption 3.1 is not clear what $L_H$ is.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2768,This quantity never mentioned before.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2769,"Reading the Lemmas of Section 4 (Lemma 4.4) you can see that it is the smoothness parameter of function $H$. Thus, is not necessary to have it there (not important for the definition).",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2770,"3) What is the main difference on the combination of assumptions on Theorems 3.2, 3.2 and 3.4. Which one is stronger. Is there a reason for the existence of Theorem 3.3?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2771,4) All the results heavily depend on the PL condition.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2772,"I think having this in mind, showing the convergence of Theorems 3.2-3.4 is somehow trivial.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2773,"In particular, one can propose several combinations of assumptions in order for the function H to satisfy the PL condition.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2774,Can we avoid having the PL condition?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2775,The authors need to elaborate more on this.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2776,"5) In Theorem 5.2, the term 1/sqrt(2) is missing from the final bound.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2777,Minor Suggestions:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2778,"In first paragraph of page 5 where the authors divide the existing literature into the three particular cases, I am suggesting to add the refereed papers inside each one of this cases (which papers assumed function g bilinear , which papers strongly convex-concave etc.)",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
2779,I understand that the main contribution of the work is the theoretical analysis of the proposed method but would like to see some numerical evaluation in the main paper.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2780,There are some preliminary results in the appendix but it will be useful for the reader if there are are some plots showing the benefit of the method in comparison with existing methods that guarantee convergence (which method is faster?).,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2781,In the current experiments there is a comparison only with CO algorithm and SGDA.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,2,7
2782,"In general i find the paper interesting, with nice ideas and I believe that will be appreciated from researchers that are interested on smooth games and their connections to machine learning applications.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3

2784,**********after rebuttal,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2785,********,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2786,I would like to thank the authors for their reply and for the further clarification.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2787,I will keep my score the same but I highly encourage the authors to add some clarification related to my last comment on the globally bounded gradient.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2788,In their response they mentioned that the analysis only requires that  H is smooth and that $\|\xi(x^{(0)})\|$ is sufficient bound.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2789,This needs to be clear in the paper (add clear arguments and related references).,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2790,"In addition, in their response they highlight the non-increasing nature of function H over the course of the algorithm which is important for their argument.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2791,Having this in mind note that the theoretical results on stochastic variant presented in the paper are wrong.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2792,"In SGD,  function H does not necessarily decrease over the course of the algorithm.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2793,The authors either need to remove these results or restate them in a different way in order to satisfy the assumed conditions.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2794,1. I had hard time to understand latent canonicalization.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2795,"Do you mean that each latent variable is fixed to a value, such that this factor of variation is disabled? Are the canonicalizers pre-specified using meta-labels? Are they updated/learned during model training?",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6
2796,More explanation of canonicalization is needed.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2797,Perhaps an example in linear algebra is needed.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2798,2. The learning of the proposed model relies on meta-data description such that the learning is supervised. Can the method be applicable to situations where no meta-data and no class labels are available?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2799,3. How can the proposed method be generalized to non-image data?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2800,The experiments were only done on simple image datasets.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6

2806,i have change my rating from 5 to 6 after reading the numerous and thorough rebuttals from the authors.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2807,I hope they will incorporate these clarifications and additional experiments into the final version of the paper if accepted.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2808,The purpose of this paper is presumably to approximate the margin of a sample as accurately as possible.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2809,This is clearly an intractable problem.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2810,"Thus all attacks make some kind of approximation, including this paper.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2811,"I am still a bit confused about the difference between ""zero-confidence attacks"" and those that don't fall into that category such as PGD.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2812,"Since all of these are approximations, and we cannot know how far we are from the true margin, I don't see why these categories help.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2813,The authors spend two paragraphs in the introduction trying to draw a distinction but I am still not convinced.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2814,"The proofs provided by the authors assume that convexity and many assumptions, which makes it not very useful for the real world case.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2815,"What would have been helpful is to show the accuracy of their margin for simple binary toy 2D problems, where the true margin and their approximation can be visualized.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2816,This was not done.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2817,This reduces the paper to an empirical exercise rather than a true understanding of their method's advantages and limitations.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2818,"Finally, the experimental results do not show any significant advantage over PGD, either in running time (they are slower) or norm perturbation.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2819,"Thus their novelty rests on the definition of zero confidence attack, and of the importance of such a attack.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2820,So clarifying the above question will help to judge the paper's novelty.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2821,This paper proposes a method for unsupervised learning  of data representations that can be manipulated to remove factors of variation via linear transformations.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2822,These transformations are called canonicalizations in the paper.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2823,"The canonicalizations are trained such that images for arbitrary values of the corresponding factor of variation are transformed into images with a fixed, canonical, value for that factor.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2824,"The paper proposes a model architecture based on a denoising autoencoder, where the canonicalizations are applied to the encoded representation.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2825,It also proposes a loss function and sampling scheme for training the model.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2826,"The paper demonstrates the method on the dSprites dataset, showing that it can effectively learn linear canonicalizations, and that multiple of these canonicalizations can be applied to the same image representation.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2827,"The paper goes on to test the method on a digit classification task, where the model is trained to learn a representation in a simulator for SVHN data where the transformations to be canonicalized can be controlled, and  used to train a classifier on unseen real data from the SVHN test set.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2828,"I think this paper should be accepted as it proposes a novel idea, which does not seem too difficult to reproduce, describes a simulator for synthetic data for digit recognition, and proposes it as a benchmark for learning representations, and provides experimental results that help in better understanding the representation learned by the model.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
2829,A couple things I thought were missing in the paper:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2830,Did you try applying the classification loss to both the encoded representation and the canonicalized representation at the same time?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2831,"For Figure 2, Did you try applying canonicalizations in different orders? Do they give the same results?",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2832,"Instead of trying to learn idempotency by gradient descent, you could try to parametrize the canonicalizations with a matrix X, such that C =  X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T. C will be idempotent (although restricted to be symmetric).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2833,There might be other constructions that are more efficient and less restrictive.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6

2841,"To me this paper is just not good enough - the method essentially i) use ""a professor and two teaching assistants"" to build a ""rule-based concept extractor"" for problems, then ii) map problems into this ""concept space"" and simply treat them as words. There are several problems with this approach.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2842,"First, doing so does not touch the core of the proposed application.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2843,"For tutoring applications, the most important thing is to select a problem that can help students improve; even if you can indeed select a problem that is the most similar to another problem, is it the best one to show a student?

2844,"Moreover, the main difference between math problems and other problems is that there are math expressions; I do not think that using words/concept labels only is enough without touching on the math expressions.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

2851,"The paper is written well overall, clearly explaining the results obtained.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
2852,I would like to raise several important points:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2853,"1. Missing comparison with parameter counting bounds: there has been a long line of research on generalization bounds for RNNs by obtaining bounds on the VC dimension of the function class [1, 2] which provide generalization bounds for various non-linearities.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,2,7
2854,The bounds obtained are polynomial in the sequence length T (often sublinear or linear) and should be compared with the existing bounds for a thorough comparison.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

2856,A quick glance at Table 1 suggests that the bounds obtained through Theorem 3 are exponential in t and are mostly vacuous.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
2857,They can indeed be subsumed by generalization bounds based on VC theory.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6

2885,The authors achieve this by analyzing HGD and giving convergence rates for when a “sufficiently bilinear condition is satisfied”.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

2897,"1. A comprehensive empirical comparison of deep learning optimizers, with their performance compared under different amount of hyper-parameter tuning (they perform hyper-parameter tuning using random search).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2898,"2. The introduction of a novel metric that tries to capture the ""tunability"" of an optimizer.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2899,"This metric attempts to trade off the performance of an optimizer when tuned only with a small number of hyper-parameter trials, and its performance when carefully tuned.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2900,"The metric is defined as a weighted average of the performance after tuning with i random trials, with i that goes from 1 to K.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2901,"The weights of this weighted average and K are ""hyper-parameters"" of the metric itself.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
2902,They use K=100 and suggest 3 possible choices of weights.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2903,The paper appears to treat 2. as the main contribution.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2904,"However, I do not think the metric they introduce is good enough to be recommended in future work, when comparing tunability of optimizers (or other algorithms with hyperparameters).",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2905,"The reason is that simpler methods provide just as much information, and do not rely on the need of interpreting the choice of the weights and K. This point is proven in the paper itself, where for example Figure 2 provides a more concrete and easier to interpret information than the tunability metric, similar graphs could be easily provided per dataset.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2906,"Similarly, figure 3 as well as figures 5-7 and 8 in the appendix provide very good information about the tunability of the various optimizers without using the introduced metrics.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

2912,"I enjoyed reading the submission, which is very clearly written, but due to the relatively limited value of the contributions, and excessive focus on the tunability metric which I do not feel is giustified, I slightly lean against acceptance here at ICLR. I do think, however, that it would make a great submission to a smaller venue or workshop.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
2913,Other comments/notes:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
2914,"* One aspects that is mostly left out of the discussion (except from one side comment) is the wallclock time, as some optimizers might be on average quicker to train (for example due to quicker convergence), this can easily lead it to be quicker to tune even though it requires a higher budget of trials.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
2915,I think it would be worth discussing this more.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
2916,"* minor: in figure 8 in the appendix, the results after 100 iterations is, as far as I understand, over a single replication, so is not particularly reliable (and will always be 100% of a single optimizer)",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

2962,"Furthermore, the robust MDP view of the AGZ in sequential decision-making problems is not so impressive either.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6

3117,Introduction:,asp,none,8.0,8,8

3119,based on the definition of conductance and attribution.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3120,- First paragraph would be more clear with simple word explanation rather than maths.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3121,"Also, second sentence is not a complete sentence",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3122,- Work on image indicators of importance could be compared better with current work.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
3123,Indicators can be seen as a measure of importance.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3124,"- This sentence is not clear: ""[...]; the nature of correlations in the two models may differ"".",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3125,Section 2:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3126,- Last paragraph of section 2 can be true for any well-performing importance measure.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3127,The statements should be put in perspective with others.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3128,Section 3:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3129,- Section 3 should be introduced by explaining the goal of the section otherwise it breaks the flow of reading.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3130,- The role of the baseline x' should be better explained when it is presented (first paragraph of section 3).,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3131,"- The interchangeable use of the term ""conductance of neuron j"" for equations 2 and 3 is confusing.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3132,"Different terms should be use, even if the context makes it possible to infer which one is being referred to.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3133,"- Remark 1 seems trivial, but the selection of baseline x' seems less trivial.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3134,Some explanations should be devoted to it.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3135,- Second paragraph of remark 1 is not clear.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3136,"Why couldn't we take another layer's neuron as the neuron of interest, bounding the conductance measure on one layer as the input and the output of the model? If we make the input to be a neuron y rather than the true input x, we could take another neuron z in a subsequent layer to be the neuron of interest, resulting in conductance measure Cond^z_i(y).",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,6,1
3137,Section 4:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3138,- List of importance measure at beginning of Section 4 should probably have citations.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
3139,"- Backward reference to section 3 seems to be a mistake, should it be subsection 4.2?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3140,- Each of the justifications to get around the issue of distinguishing strange model behavior from bad feature importance technique should be explained briefly in paragraph before section 4.1.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3141,Subsection 4.1:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3142,- I do not understand the problem explained in fourth paragraph of section 4.1.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3143,"g(f(1 - epsilon)) = 0, why would it be 1- epsilon?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3144,- Problem explained in fifth Paragraph of section is not clear unless what the influence of the unit is clearly stated. Is it simply dg/df?,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3145,- A short explanation of what is tested in section 6 should be given at last paragraph of section 4.1.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3146,"Although the results are favorable to the conductance metric, it is not clear how they precisely confirm the problem of incorrect signs presented in the caricature examples.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
3147,Subsection 4.2:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3148,"- As said in the my main comments, I am not convinced by the use of the term Axiom. They are not use as building blocks, and are rather used as desirable properties for which the authors prove that only ""path methods"" can satisfy.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,6,1
3149,- Footnote 2 on page 5 it difficult to read.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3150,"- Although the proof does not seem to use the axioms as a building block, which is fortunate since it would make it a circular argument otherwise, the text suggests so: ""Given these three axioms, we can show that:"".",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3151,- The importance of section 4.2 should be clarified.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3152,More emphasis on the importance of the axioms (desirable properties) should be made.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3153,Section 5:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3154,- Choices for experiments should be explained. Why choosing layers mixed** rather than others? Why choosing filters?,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3155,- Figures 1-4 are difficult to interpreted on a printed version.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3156,"Since this is qualitative, I suggest to change the saturation of the images to make them easier to interpret.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3157,The absolute values are not important for a qualitative interpretation,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3158,"- Figure 4 could be more interesting if compared with other classes, like other animal faces.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3159,"Anyhow, I understand that those were chosen based on the subset of classes used for the experiments.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3160,- Space should be added between figures to better divide the captions,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3161,Section 6:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3162,- The difference between experiments of Figure 5 and 6 should be made more clear.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3163,Section 7-8:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3164,- Where are they? No discussion? No conclusion?,asp,arg_other,0.0,1,0
3165,The paper presents algorithms for solving computational problems in a datastream model augmented with an oracle learned from data.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3166,"The authors show that under this model, there exist algorithms that have significantly better time and space complexity than the current best known algorithms that do not use an oracle.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3167,The authors support their theoretical analysis with experiments in which the oracle is represented by a deep neural network and demonstrate improvement over classical algorithms that do not use machine learning.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3168,"Overall, this paper seems like a solid contribution to the literature.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,3,7
3169,"However, in its current state it does seem to be presented and motivated in a way that is appropriate for the audience of ML researchers at ICLR.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
3170,"It reads very much like a STOC theory paper, and a lot of the key ML details that would be relevant to audience at this conference seem to have been shoved under the rug in a way.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3171,"Therefore my score for now is a weak reject, but I am very happy to increase the score if the authors address my presentations concerns.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3172,Major comments:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3173,* The oracle-augmented datasteam model needs to be contextualized better.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3174,I don't have a good sense of whether this is a reasonable theoretical model to explore and a lot of very basic questions remain unanswered for me.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3175,"For example, how do I even know that the oracle in question exists? What are the particular assumptions under which it exists? What are the requirements on the training data, optimization ability, generalization error, etc. How do we know that we can create in practice ML learning models that are sufficiently accurate to serve as an oracle?",asp,none,8.0,6,8
3176,* The connections to deep learning seem arbitrary in some of the experiments.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3177,"In one of the experiments, the authors train neural networks over a concatenation of IP address embeddings.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3178,Why do we need to use deep learning here?,asp,none,8.0,6,8
3179,What is the benefit of using DL algorithms within the oracle-augmented datastream model?,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3180,Is a simple algorithm enough? What algorithms should we ideally use in practice?,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3181,What if you used simpler online learning algorithms with formal accuracy guarantees?,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3182,Minor comments:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3183,* I thought there was a bit over-selling in intro.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3184,The authors say that they match the theoretical lower bounds for several problems.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3185,"However, you are in a different computational model in which you now have access to an oracle.",asp,arg_other,0.0,8,0
3186,"This needs to be made more explicitly, and language could be a bit toned down (e.g. in this model, we can obtain runtime that match or improve over lower bounds...)",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3187,The authors propose a new on-policy exploration strategy by using a policy with a hierarchy of stochasticity.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3188,"The authors use a two-level hierarchical distribution as a policy, where the global variable is used for dropout.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3189,This work is interesting since the authors use dropout for policy learning and exploration.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3190,The authors show that parameter noise exploration is a particular case of the proposed policy.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3191,The main concern is the gap between the problem formulation and the actual optimization problem in Eq 12.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3192,I am very happy to give a higher rating if the authors address the following points.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3193,Detailed Comments,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3194,(1) The authors give the derivation for Eq 10.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3195,"However, it is not obvious that how to move from line 3 to line 4 at Eq 15.",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
3196,"Minor:  Since the action is denoted by ""a"",  it will be more clear if the authors use another symbol to denote the parameter of q(z) instead of ""\alpha"" at Eq 10 and 15.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3197,"(2) Due to the use of the likelihood ratio trick, the authors use the mean policy as an approximation at Eq 12.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3198,Does such approximation guarantee the policy improvement?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3199,Any justification?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3200,"(3) Instead of using the mean policy approximation in Eq 12, the authors should consider existing Monte Carlo techniques to reduce the variance of the gradient estimation.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3201,"For example, [1] could be used to reduce the variance of gradient w.r.t. \phi.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3202,Note that the gradient is biased if the mean policy approximation is used.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3203,(4) Are \theta and \phi jointly and simultaneously optimized at Eq 12?,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
3204,The authors should clarify this point.,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
3205,"(5) Due to the mean policy approximation, does the mean policy depend on \phi?",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
3206,The authors should clearly explain how to update \phi when optimizing Eq 12.,asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
3207,"(6) If the authors jointly and simultaneously optimize \theta and \phi, why a regularization term about q_{\phi}(z)  is missing in Eq 12 while a regularization term about \pi_{\theta|z} does appear in Eq 12?",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3208,"(7) The authors give the derivations about \theta such as the gradient and the regularization term about \theta (see, Eq 18-19).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3209,"However, the derivations about \phi are missing.",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5
3210,"For example, how to compute the gradient w.r.t. \phi? Since the mean policy is used, it is not apparent that how to compute the gradient w.r.t. \phi.",asp,asp_replicability,5.0,1,5

3214,"The author's present a dual learning framework that, instead of using a single mapping for each mapping task between two respective domains, the authors learn multiple diverse mappings.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3215,These diverse mappings are learned before the two main mappings are trained and are kept constant during the training of the two main mappings.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3216,"Though I am not familiar with BLEU scores and though I didn't grasp some of the details in 3.1, the algorithm yielded consistent improvement over the given baselines.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3217,The author's included many different experiments to show this.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3218,The idea that multiple mappings will produce better results than a single mapping is reasonable given previous results on ensemble methods.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3219,"For the language translation results, were there any other state-of-the-art methods that the authors could compare against? It seems they are only comparing against their own implementations.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

3225,After reading author feedback,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3226,Thank you for the feedback.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3227,After reading the updated paper I still believe that 6 is the right score for this paper.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3228,The method produces better results using ensemble learning.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3229,"While the results seem impressive, the method to obtain them is not very novel; nonetheless, I would not have a problem with it being accepted, but I don't think it would be a loss if it were not accepted.",asp,none,8.0,4,8
3230,The authors propose a generative model of networks by learning embeddings and pairing the embeddings with a prior distribution over networks.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3231,The idea is that the prior distribution may explain structure that the embeddings would not have to capture.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3232,The motivation for doing this is that this structure is typically hard to model for network embeddings.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,7,3
3233,The authors propose a clean -if improper- prior on networks and proceed to perform maximum likelihood inference on it.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3234,The experiments show that the approach works fine for link porediction and can be used for visualization.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
3235,Two points:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3236,a) Why not try to do this with Variational inference? It should conceptually still work and be fast and potentially more robust.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3237,b) The prior seems to be picked according to properties of the observed data and expressed in a product of constraints.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
3238,"This seems clunky, I would have been more impressed with a prior structure that ties in closer with the embeddings and requires less hand-engineering.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3239,A key point of interest is the following: very exciting recent work (GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs with Deep Auto-regressive Models by You et al ICML2018) has proposed neural generative models of networks with a high degree of fidelity and much less hand-picked features.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
3240,The work here tries to not learn a lot of these structures but impose them.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3241,Do the authors think that ultimately learning priors with models like GraphRNN might be more promising for certain applications?,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3242,"The drawback in this model here is that ultimately networks are embedded, but not really generated during test time.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
3243,A more predictive generative model that makes less hard assumptions on graph data would be interesting.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3244,Update After rebuttal:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3245,"Given the authors' rebuttal to all reviews, I am upgrading my score to a 6.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3246,"I still feel that more learning (as inGraphRNN) to build a fuller generative model of the graph would be interesting, but the authors make a strong case for the usefulness and practicality of their approach.",asp,none,8.0,3,8
3247,"This work focuses on learning a good policy for hyperparameters schedulers, for example learning rate or weight decay, using reinforcement learning.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3248,The main contributions include 1) a discretization on the learning curves such that transformer can be applied to predict the them; 2) an empirical evaluations using the predicted learning curves to train the policy.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3249,The main novelties are two folds.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3250,"On the methodology side, using predicted learning curves instead of real ones can speed up training significantly.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3251,"On the technical side, the author presented a discretization step to use transformer for learning curve predictions.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3252,"The results are mixed, we see slightly advantage over human baseline on one task but worse in the other.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3253,Human baseline does not need any training!,asp,none,8.0,8,8

3259,How does the transformer based method comparing to others?,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3260,"This paper builds upon the assumption that GANs successfully approximate the data manifold, and uses this assumption to regularize semi-supervised learning process.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3261,The proposed regularization strategy enforces that a discriminator or a given classifier should be invariant to small perturbations on the data manifold z. It is empirically shown that naively enforcing such a constraint by randomly adding noise to z could lead to under-smoothing or over-smoothing in some cases which can harm the final classification performance.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3262,"Consequently, the proposed regularization technique takes a step of tunable size in the direction of the manifold gradient, which has the effect of smoothing along the direction of the gradient while ignoring its norm.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3263,"Extensive experiments have been conducted, showing that the proposed approach",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3264,"outperforms or is comparable with recent state-of-the-art approaches on cifar 10, especially in presence of fewer labelled data points.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3265,"On SVHN however, the proposed approach fails in comparison with (Kumar et al 2017) but performs better than other approaches.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3266,"Furthermore, it has been shown that adding the proposed manifold regularization technique to the training of GAN greatly improves the image quality of generated images (in terms of FID scores and inception scores).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3267,"Also, by combining the proposed regularizer with a classical supervised classifier (via pre-training a GAN and using it for regularization) decreases classification error by 2 to 3%.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3268,"Finally, it has also been shown that after training a GAN using the manifold regularization, the algorithm is able to produce similar images giving a low enough perturbation of the data manifold z.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3269,"Overall, this paper is well written and show significant improvements especially for image generation.",asp,none,8.0,7,8
3270,"However, the novelty is rather limited as similar ideas have been undertaken (e.g., Mescheder et al 2018), but in different contexts.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
3271,The paper would be improved if the following points are taken into account:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3272,A comparison with Graph Convolutional Network based techniques seems appropriate (e.g. Kipf and Welling 2017).,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2
3273,How do the FID/Inception improvements compare to (Mescheder et al 2018)?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
3274,It would be interesting to discuss why the FID score for SVHN gets worse in presence of 1000 labels.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,7,1
3275,Although there is a clear improvement in FID scores for Cifar10.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3276,It would be informative to show the generated images w/ and w/o manifold regularization.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3277,More analysis should be provided on why (Kumar et al 2017) perform so well on SVHN.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3278,It should be stated that bold values in tables do not represent best results (as it is usually the case) but rather results for the proposed approach.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3279,[Summary],asp,none,8.0,8,8
3280,The paper presents a video classification framework that employs 4D convolution to capture longer term temporal structure than the popular 3D convolution schemes.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3281,This is achieved by treating the compositional space of local 3D video snippets as an individual dimension where an individual convolution is applied.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3282,"The 4D convolution is integrated in resnet blocks and implemented via first applying 3D convolution to regular spatio-temporal video volumes and then the compositional space convolution, to leverage existing 3D operators.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3283,Empirical evaluation on three benchmarks against other baselines suggested the advantage of the proposed method.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

3287,[Comments],asp,none,8.0,8,8
3288,"At the conceptual level, the idea of jointly modeling local video events is not novel, and can date back to at least ten years ago in the paper “Learning realistic human actions from movies”, where the temporal pyramid matching was combined with the bag-of-visual-words framework to capture long-term temporal structure.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
3289,"The problem with this strategy is that the rigid composition only works for actions that can be split into consecutive temporal parts with prefixed duration and anchor points in time, which is clearly challenged by many works later when more complicated video events are studied.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3290,"It seems to me that the proposed framework also falls in this category, with a treatment from deep learning.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3291,It is definitely worth some discussion on this path.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3292,"That said, I would like to see more analysis on the behavior of the proposed method under various interesting cases not tested yet.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3293,"Despite the claim that the proposed method can capture long-term video patterns, the static compositional nature seems to work best for activities with well-defined local events and clear temporal boundaries.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

3304,This paper presents a method for unsupervised representation learning of speech.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3305,"The idea is to first learn discrete representation (vector quantization is done by Gumbel softmax or k-means) from audio samples with contrastive prediction coding type objective, and then perform BERT-style pre-training (borrowed from NLP).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3306,"The BERT features are used as inputs to ASR systems, rather than the usual log-mel features.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3307,"The idea, which combines those of previous work (wav2vec and BERT) synergetically, is intuitive and clearly presented, significant improvements over log-mel and wav2vec were achieved on ASR benchmarks WSJ and TIMIT.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
3308,"Based on these merits, I suggest this paper to be accepted.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
3309,"On the other hand, I would suggest directions for investigation and improvements as follows.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3310,"1. While I understand that vector quantization makes the use of NLP-style BERT-training possible (as the inputs to NLP models are discrete tokens),  there are potential disadvantages as well.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3311,"One observation from the submission is that the token set may need to very large (from tens of thousands to millions) for the system to work well, making the BERT training computationally expensive (I noticed that the BERT model is trained on 128 GPUs)",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3312,.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3313,"Also, without BERT pre-training, using directly the discrete tokens seems to consistently give worse performance for ASR.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3314,I think some more motivations or explorations (what kind of information did BERT learn) are needed to understand why that is the case.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3315,"2. Besides the computational expensive-ness of the three-step approach (vector quantization, BERT, acoustic model training), the combined model complexity is large because these steps do not share neural network architecture.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3316,"A more economical approach is to use BERT-trained model as initialization for acoustic model training, which is the classical way how RBMs pre-training were used in ASR.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
3317,3. One concern I have with discrete representation is how robust they are wrt different dataset.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3318,The ASR datasets used in this work are relatively clean (but there does exists domain difference between them).,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3319,"It remains to see how the method performs with more acoustically-challenging speech data, and how universally useful the learned features are (as is the case for BERT in NLP).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3320,"4. Another curious question is whether the features would still provide as much improvement when a stronger ASR system than AutoSeg (e.g., Lattice-free MMI) is used.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,7,1

3485,* an interesting model which is quite intriguing in its simplicity.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4

3487,* mostly clear writing and presentation (few typos etc. nothing too serious).,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3488,Cons and comments:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3489,* The author say explicitly that this is not a convolutional model because of the use of 1x1 convolutions.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3490,I disagree and I actually think this is important for two reasons.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3491,"First, though these are 1x1 convolutions, because of the up-sampling operation and the layer wise normalizations the influence of each operation goes beyond the 1x1 support.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3492,"Furthermore, and more importantly is the weight sharing scheme induced by this - using convolutions is a very natural choice for natural images (no pun intended) due to the translation invariant statistics of natural images.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3493,I doubt this would have worked so well hadn't it been modeled this way (not to mention this allows a small number of parameters).,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3494,* The upsampling analysis is interesting but it is only done on synthetic data - will the result hold for natural images as well? should be easy to try and will allow a better understanding of this choice.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3495,Natural images are only approximately piece-wise smooth after all.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3496,"* The use of the name ""batch-norm"" for the layer wise normalization is both wrong and misleading.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3497,"This is just channel-wise normalization with some extra parameters - no need to call it this way (even if it's implemented with the same function) as there is no ""batch"".",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3498,* I would have loved to see actual analysis of the method's performance as a function of the noise standard deviation.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

3664,"However, the following implicit assumptions/limitations of the approach should be made more clear:",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3665,"- important features for the new task should be in similar locations as important features of the old task (for example, one would expect that the proposed approach would negatively affect learning the new task if the important features of the old task were all located in the bottom of the image, while all important features for the new task are in the top)",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

3667,"Therefore, an interesting baseline for the evaluation of the ICL approach would be a predefined, fixed attention map consisting of concentric circles with the image center as their center, to show that the proposed approach does more than just deemphasizing the corners of the image)",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3668,"Furthermore, the authors appear to imply that increased FSM values for an old task after training on a new task indicate catastrophic forgetting.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3669,"While this is a reasonable assumption, it does not necessarily seem to be the case that a larger, more disconnected saliency map indicates worse classification performance.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3670,"Comparatively small changes in FSM may not affect the classification performance at all, while larger changes may not necessarily lead to worse classifications either.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
3671,"For example, by increasing the amount or size of image regions to be considered, the classifier may accidentally become more robust on an old task.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

3867,"This paper proposes to combine unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation with prototypical networks and finds that the proposed model performs well on few-shot learning task with domain shift, much better than other few-shot learning baselines that do not consider.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3868,Specifically it tests on Omniglot with natural image background and cliparts to real images.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3869,"It is true that current meta-learning approaches do not address the problem of domain shift, and as a result, the testing domain has to be the same with the training domain.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3870,"However, this paper rather than proposing solution address the meta-learning problem, albeit the title “meta domain adaptation”, only brings few-shot learning to domain adaptation.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3871,Here’s why:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3872,"In order for a meta-learning model to be called “meta domain adaptation,” the type of adaptation cannot be seen during training, and the goal is to test on adaptation that the model has not seen before.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3873,"Indeed, each task in meta domain adaptation should be seen as a pair of source task and target task.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3874,"The problem with the current model is that during training, it is trained to target at one specific type of test domain--the generator network G aims to generated images that align with the unsupervised  test domain X_test.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3875,"Thus, the trained model will also only be able to handle one test domain, not much different than regular meta-learning models.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3876,"In short, the meta-learning part stays in the regular few-shot learning module (which is implemented as a prototypical network), and has nothing related to domain adaptation.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
3877,"Therefore, the paper cannot be qualified for ``meta domain adaptation’’ and has very limited novelty in terms of its contribution to meta-learning; however, the combination of domain adaptation and few-shot learning is fair.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
3878,"For the rest of my review, I will treat the paper as “few-shot learning with domain adaptation” for more appropriate analysis.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3879,"For the experiments, there seems to have a great win of the proposed algorithm against the baselines.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3880,"However, I think since this is few-shot learning with domain adaptation, there is no domain adaptation baselines being mentioned in comparison.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2
3881,"Specifically, what if the few-shot learning component is removed, and the network is trained with standard domain adaptation.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3882,Then use the same network to extract the features and then using the nearest neighbor to retrieve the classes.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3883,"Also it seems that the regular batch normalization could be very sensitive to domain shifts, and it would be good if the authors can test other normalization schemes such as layer/group normalization as baselines.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3884,Another concern is that the evaluation of domain adaptation does not have much varieties.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3885,"Only two domains shifts are evaluated in the paper, specifically Omniglot + BSD500 and Office-Home.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3886,"BSD 500 only contains 500 images, and it would be good if more diverse set of images are considered.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

3893,===,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3894,After rebuttal:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3895,I would like to thank the authors for the response and updating the draft.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3896,They have addressed 1) the title issue and 2) adding domain adaptation baselines.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3897,"Considering these improvements, I would like to raise the score to 5, since the setting of combining few-shot learning and domain adaptation is interesting and the proposed model outperforms the baselines.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3

3899,"The experiments use fairly small datasets, where the performance can be largely influenced by how good the feature extractor backbone is (e.g. training on more data and using deeper architecture would warrant better performance, and thus may change the conclusion).",asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3900,The idea of having a separate class for out-distribution is a very interesting idea but unfortunately previously explored.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
3901,"In fact, in machine learning and NLP there is the OOV class which sometimes people in computer vision also use.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,2,4
3902,Some of the claims in the paper can be further substantiated or explored.,asp,none,8.0,7,8
3903,For example in abstract there is a simple claim that is presented too strong: We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3904,This claim is bigger than just CNNs and needs to be studied in a theoretical framework not an empirical one.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
3905,"Also, one simple way to stop these adversarial cases would be to explore using Sigmoid as opposed to softmax.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
3906,In general it is very unlikely that you will be able to choose every variation of out-distribution cases.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3907,Much easier if you just try to solve the problem using a set of n Sigmoids (n total number of classes) and consider each output a probability distribution.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6

3909,# Summary,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3910,"This paper proposes a new kind of spherical convolution for use in spherical CNNs, and evaluates it on rigid and non-rigid 3D shape recognition and retrieval problems.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3911,Previous work has either used general anisotropic convolution or azimuthally isotropic convolution.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3912,"The former produces feature maps on SO(3), which is deemed undesirable because processing 3-dimensional feature maps is costly.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3913,"The latter produces feature maps on the sphere, but requires that filters be circularly symmetric / azimuthally isotropic, which limits modeling capacity.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3914,This paper proposes an anisotropic spherical convolution that produces 2D spherical feature maps.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3915,"The paper also introduces an efficient way of processing geodesic / icosahedral spherical grids, avoiding complicated spectral algorithms.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3916,# Strengths,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3917,The paper has several strong points.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
3918,"It is well written, clearly structured, and the mathematics is clear and precise while avoiding unnecessary complexity.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3919,"Much of the relevant related work is discussed, and this is done in a balanced way.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,8,2
3920,"Although it is not directly measured, it does seem highly likely that the alt-az convolution is more computationally efficient than SO(3) convolution, and more expressive than isotropic S2 convolution.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,8,2
3921,"The most important contribution in my opinion is the efficient data structure presented in section 4, which allows the spherical convolution to be computed efficiently on GPUs for a grid that is much more homogeneous than the lat/lon grids used in previous works (which have very high resolution near the poles, and low resolution at the equator).",asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3922,"The idea of carving up the icosahedral grid in just the right way, so that the spherical convolution can be computed as a planar convolution with funny boundary conditions, is very clever, elegant, and practical.",asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
3923,# Weaknesses,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3924,There is however a misunderstanding about the properties of the alt-az convolution that must be cleared up before this paper can be published.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,2,7
3925,"To start with, the set of rotations R(phi, nu, 0) called the alt-az group in this paper is not a group in the mathematical sense.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3926,"This easy to see, because a composition of rotations of the form Rz(phi) Ry(nu) is not generally of that form.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
3927,"For instance we can multiply Rz(phi) Ry(nu) by the element Rz(omega)Ry(0) = Rz(omega), which gives the element Rz(phi) Ry(nu) Rz(omega).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3928,"As noted in the paper, this is a general element of SO(3) (and hence not in the set of alt-az rotations)",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
3929,.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
3930,So the closure axiom of a group is violated.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
3931,"This matters, because the notion of equivariance really only makes sense for a group.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
3932,"If a layer l satisfies l R = R l  (for R a alt-az rotation), then it automatically satisfies l RR' = RR' l, which means l is equivariant to the whole group generated by the set of alt-az rotations.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3933,"As we saw before, this is the whole rotation group.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3934,"This would mean that the layer is actually SO(3)-equivariant, but it has been proven [1], that any rotation equivariant layer between scalar spherical feature maps can be expressed as an azimuthally isotropic convolution.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
3935,"Since the alt-az convolution is not isotropic and maps between scalars on S2, it cannot be equivariant.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
3936,"This also becomes apparent in the experiments section, where rotational data augmentation is found to be necessary.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
3937,"The paper does not contain an attempted proof of equivariance, and if one tries to give one, the impossibility of doing so will become apparent.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
3938,I note that the alt-az convolution *is* equivariant to rotations in the subgroup SO(2) of rotations around the Z-axis.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3939,Another somewhat jarring fact about the alt-az convolution is that it is not well defined on the south pole.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
3940,"The south pole can be represented by any pair of coordinates of the form phi in [0, 2pi], nu = +/- pi.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
3941,"But it is easy to see that eq. 10 will give different results for each of these coordinates, because they correspond to different rotations of the filter about the Z-axis.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,8,6
3942,"This is ultimately due to the fact that the set of alt-az rotations is not the same as the set of points on the sphere, topologically speaking.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
3943,The set of points on the sphere can only be viewed as the quotient SO(3)/S(2).,asp,arg_other,0.0,1,0

3950,That they do not substantially outperform these and other methods,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,8,2

4147,"First, the paper argues that given a DNN, it's possible to construct either an identical output network or a comparable network that can have very different behavior for some of the statistical characteristics.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

4149,"The paper conducts experiments with different regularizers associated with some of the standard statistical characteristics using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4150,The paper claims that for each dataset the best performing network cannot be attributed to any single regularizer.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4151,"For the same set of regularizers and the MNIST dataset, the paper then explores the mutual information between the inputs and the hidden layer activations.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4152,The paper observes that the best performing regularizer is the one which minimizes this mutual information.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4153,"Therefore, it is plausible that the mutual information regularization can consistently explain the performance of an NN.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4154,The paper addresses an interesting problem and makes some good contributions.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3

4163,Fixing this would significantly improve the paper.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4164,Main remarks:,asp,none,8.0,8,8

4167,"- White-box attack experiments don’t really prove the strength of the method, even with imagenet experiments, as almost all attacks get 100% success rate making it hard to compare.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4168,"Need to compare in more challenging settings where the success rate is meaningful, e.g. smaller epsilon or a more robust NN using some defence.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4169,Also stating the 100% success rate in the abstract is a bit misleading for the this reason.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
4170,"-Something is a bit weird with the FGM results. While it is a weaker attack, a 0%/100% disparity between it and every other",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
4171,attack seems odd.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4172,-The average distortion metric (that’s unfavourable to your method anyway) doesn’t really mean anything as the constraint optimization has no incentive to find a value smaller than the constraint.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
4173,"- Regarding lambda>1, you write that “we argue this modification makes our algorithm more general, and gives rise to better attack results”.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4174,I did not see any theoretical or empirical support for this in the paper.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,7,6
4175,"Also, it seems quite strange to me that making the FW overshot and then projecting back would be beneficial.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
4176,Some intuitive explanation on why this should help and/or empirical comparison would be a great addition.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4177,"- The authors claim that this is the first zeroth-order non-convex FW convergence rate, I am not familiar enough with the field to evaluate this claim and its significance.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4178,"- Alg. 1 for T>1 is very similar to I-FGM, but also ‘pulls’ x_t towards x_orig.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

4193,"In particular, the derived criterion is comparable to other sparsity-inducing penalities on variable inclusion in machine learning models; although it has motivation in causality it is not exclusively derived from this position, so one might wonder how alternative sparsity penalities might perform on the same challenge.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2

4384,"The FW algorithm is a classical method in optimization, but (to the best of my knowledge) has not yet been evaluated yet for constructing adversarial examples.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

4442,- What are the motivations to use Frank-Wolfe ? Usually this algorithm is used when the constraints are to complicated to have a tractable projection (which is not the case for the L_2 and L_\infty balls) or when one wants to have sparse iterates which do not seem to be the case here.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

4461,===== After rebuttal ======,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4462,The authors answered some of my questions but I still think it is a borderline submission.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
4463,The paper examines an architectural feature in GAN generators -- self-modulation -- and presents empirical evidence supporting the claim that it helps improve modeling performance.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4464,The self-modulation mechanism itself is implemented via FiLM layers applied to all convolutional blocks in the generator and whose scaling and shifting parameters are predicted as a function of the noise vector z.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4465,"Performance is measured in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for models trained with and without self-modulation on a fairly comprehensive range of model architectures (DCGAN-based, ResNet-based), discriminator regularization techniques (gradient penalty, spectral normalization), and datasets (CIFAR10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, ImageNet).",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4466,The takeaway is that self-modulation is an architectural feature that helps improve modeling performance by a significant margin in most settings.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4467,"An ablation study is also performed on the location where self-modulation is applied, showing that it is beneficial across all locations but has more impact towards the later layers of the generator.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4468,"I am overall positive about the paper: the proposed idea is simple, but is well-explained and backed by rigorous evaluation.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4469,Here are the questions I would like the authors to discuss further:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4470,- The proposed approach is a fairly specific form of self-modulation.,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
4471,"In general, I think of self-modulation as a way for the network to interact with itself, which can be a local interaction, like for squeeze-and-excitation blocks.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4472,"In the case of this paper, the self-interaction allows the noise vector z to interact with various intermediate features across the generation process, which for me appears to be different than allowing intermediate features to interact with themselves.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4473,"This form of noise injection at various levels of the generator is also close in spirit to what BigGAN employs, except that in the case of BigGAN different parts of the noise vector are used to influence different parts of the generator.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4474,Can you clarify how you view the relationship between the approaches mentioned above?,asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,1,6
4475,"- It’s interesting to me that the ResNet architecture performs better with self-modulation in all settings, considering that one possible explanation for why self-modulation is helpful is that it allows the “information” contained in the noise vector to better propagate to and influence different parts of the generator.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4476,"ResNets also have this ability to “propagate” the noise signal more easily, but it appears that having a self-modulation mechanism on top of that is still beneficial.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4477,I’m curious to hear the authors’ thoughts in this.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4478,"- Reading Figure 2b, one could be tempted to draw a correlation between the complexity of the dataset and the gains achieved by self-modulation over the baseline (e.g., Bedroom shows less difference between the two approaches than ImageNet). Do the authors agree with that?",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4479,The paper proposed a novel image classifier comparison approach that went beyond one fixed testing set for all.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4480,"Instead, for a pair of classifiers to be compared, it advocated to sample their ""most disagreed"" test set from a large corpus of unlabeled images.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4481,The level of disagreement was measured by a semantic-aware distance derived from WordNet ontology.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4482,"Because of the efficacy of such ""worst-case"" comparison, the needed set size is very small and thus minimizes the human annotation workload.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4483,The proposed MAD competition distinguishes classifiers by finding their respective counterexamples.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4484,"It is therefore an ""error spotting"" mechanism, rather than a drop-in replacement of standard test accuracy.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4485,"I feel the approach to implicitly assume that the classifiers to be compared are already ""reasonably accurate""; since if not, both classifiers might be easily falsified by certain trivial examples, making the ""disagreed examples"" not as meaningful.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
4486,"If that is true, I would suggest the authors to make this hidden assumption clearer in the paper",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
4487,"The idea shows clear liaison to the ""differential testing"" concept in software engineering besides the cited work of perceptual quality assessment.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4488,The idea has a cross-disciplinary nature and is fairly interesting to me.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
4489,I can see the paper to be of interest to a quite broad audience and can motivate many subsequent works.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
4490,"One minor comment: for images in ""Case III"", the authors considered them ""contribute little to performance comparison between the two classifiers"" and therefore did not source labels for them.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

4665,Some improvement suggestions:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4666,1. I don't see why MINE cannot be applied to the fMRI dataset and results be reported.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

4682,This paper introduces a simple measure of tunability that allows to compare optimizers under varying resource constraints.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

4686,The paper is easy to follow.,asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1

4688,"In section 3.2, to characterize its difficulties of finding best hyperparameters or tunability, the authors seem to try to connect the concept of “sharpness” of a minima in loss surface to the tunability of an optimizer, which is similar to comparing the loss landscape of minimums.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

4691,"In addition, the proposed stability metric seems not quite related with the above intuitions, as the illustrations (1.a and 1b) define the tunability to be the flatness of hyperparameter space around the best configurations, but the proposed definition is a weighted sum of the incumbents in terms of the HPO budgets.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4692,"The definition of the tuning budgets is not clear, is it the number of trials or the time/computation budgets?",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
4693,"The authors seems interchangeably using “runs” and “iterations”, which makes the concept more confusable.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1

4697,My major concern is the hyperparameter distributions for each optimizer highly requires prior knowledge.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

4699,"My major concern is that the authors assume the hyperparameters to be independent (section 3.2), which is not necessarily true.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6
4700,"Actually hyperparameters are highly correlated, such as momentum, batch size and learning rate are correlated in terms of effective learning rate [1,2], so as weight decay and learning rate are [3], which means using non-zero momentum is equivalent to using large learning rate as long as the effective learning rate is the same.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4701,This could significantly increase the tunability of SGDM.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4702,Another concurrent submission [4] verified this equivalence and showed one can also just tune learning rate for SGDM.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4703,"The assumption of independent hyperparameters might be fine for black box optimization or with the assumption that practitioners have no knowledge of the importance of each hyperparameter, then the tunability of the optimizer could be different based on the prior knowledge of hyperparameter and their correlations. But it is not rigorous enough to make the conclusion that Adam is easier to tune than SGD.",asp,none,8.0,8,8

4781,This paper proposes modifications to the original Differentiable Neural Computer architecture in three ways.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4782,First by introducing a masked content-based addressing which dynamically induces a key-value separation,asp,none,8.0,8,8

4784,"Second, by modifying the de-allocation system by also multiplying the memory contents by a retention vector before an update",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4785,.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4786,"Finally, the authors propose a modification in the link distribution, through renormalization.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4787,They provide some theoretical motivation and empirical evidence that it helps avoiding memory aliasing.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4788,"The authors test their approach in the some algorithm task from the DNC paper (Copy, Associative Recall and Key-Value Retrieval), and also in the bAbi dataset.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4789,"Strengths: Overall I think the paper is well-written, and proposes simple adaptions to the DNC architecture which are theoretically grounded and could be effective for improving general performance.",asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,3,3
4790,"Although the experimental results seem promising when comparing the modified architecture to the original DNC, in my opinion there are a few fundamental problems in the empirical session (see weakness discussion bellow).",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7

4792,"For example, in the associative recall and key-value retrieval only DNC and DNC + masking are studied.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4793,"For the bAbi task, although there is a significant improvement (43%) in the mean error rate compared to the original DNC, it's important to note that performance in this task has improved a lot since the DNC paper was release. Since this is the only non-toy task in the paper, in my opinion, the authors have to discuss current SOTA on it, and have to cite, for example the universal transformer[1], entnet[2], relational nets [3], among others architectures that shown recent advances on this benchmark.",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,2,2

4862,"Somehow, those connections are not clear to me.",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
4863,"Besides some issues in the technical details, the major problem of this paper is that it uses the data processing inequality (DPI) in a **wrong** way.",asp,asp_soundness-correctness,6.0,6,6

4881,Other concerns:,asp,none,8.0,8,8
4882,"- For the cart-pole task, the paper states that the reward is modified ""to exclude any cost objective"".",asp,none,8.0,8,8
4883,Results are then presented for this modified reward showing that it results in high-frequency control signals (and that the proposed constrained approach avoids this).,asp,none,8.0,8,8

4923,"As pointed out by R2, with depth there are a lot more number of possible ways in which one could carve out decision boundaries to separate data points, thus, it is not clear that the loose linear upper bound holds Specifically, as one might expect with depth it could be possible that linear capacity increase is a lower bound (I am not suggesting that it is, but that possibility should be considered and explained in the paper).",asp,asp_clarity,1.0,1,1
4924,"Similarly, it would be good to formally connect the capacity to the rate of memorization before making a statement about them being related (as suggested in the initial review).",asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2
4925,"In general, I feel this section could use some tighter formalism and justifications.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,7,7
4926,"I also remain unconvinced by the response to my issue with the claim “Our experiments show that our networks can remember a large number of images and distinguish them from unseen images”, where the negative images are also seen by the memorization model, so they are not unseen.",asp,asp_substance,7.0,6,7
4927,The authors address this by saying 3M of the 15 M negatives have been seen.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

5148,This paper presents a new synthetic dataset to evaluate the mathematical reasoning ability of sequence-to-sequence models.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
5149,"It consists of math problems in various categories such as algebra, arithmetic, calculus, etc.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
5150,The dataset is designed carefully so that it is very unlikely there will be any duplicate between train/test split and the difficulty can be controlled.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
5151,"Several models including LSTM, LSTM + Attention, Transformer are evaluated on the proposed dataset.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
5152,The result showed some interesting insights about the evaluated models.,asp,none,8.0,8,8
5153,The evaluation of mathematical reasoning ability is an interesting perspective.,asp,none,8.0,8,8

5159,My main concerns are about the evaluation and comparison of standard neural models.,asp,asp_meaningful-comparison,2.0,7,2

5177,"Taking the perspective from signal processing, this paper proposes a pooling operation called frequency pooling (F-pooling).",asp,asp_originality,4.0,8,4
5178,The key motivation is to make the pooling operation shift-equivalent and anti-aliasing.,asp,asp_motivation-impact,3.0,8,3
5179,This paper gives an improved definition on shift-equivalent functions and shows that the proposed F-pooling is optimal in the sense of reconstructing the orignal signal.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,4,4
5180,The F-pooling is then implemented with matrix multiplications and tested with recent convolutional neural networks for image classifiation on CIFAR-100 and a subset of ImageNet dataset.,asp,asp_substance,7.0,8,7
5181,It is interesting to take the perspective from signal processing to give pooling operation in CNN a formal treatment.,asp,asp_originality,4.0,3,4

5192,"In Table 3, the F-pooling consistently shows inferior classification performance, although obtaining slightly higher consistency.",asp,none,8.0,8,8
